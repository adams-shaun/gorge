# Report — cli-20260923T060000Z-rv2b-countheads

## What changed and why

Ticket scope: the `<Ref>$<Property>` count heads the rv2b row named as
evaluating to zero — `CastTotalManaSpent`, `LifeTotal`, `CardCounters.ALL`,
`CardCounters.AGE`, `CardNumColors` — plus (this ticket owns it) the AGENTS.md
row deletion.

### Brief premise re-measured first (a claim, not a measurement)

The dispatch's system notes say a brief's counts are claims. I measured every
named head against the current tree before writing code, with a probe test
(`go test -run 'TestRefProperty' ./effects/` against unmodified `count.go`):

| named head | state at HEAD | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `CastTotalManaSpent` (ref-property) | **already reads real state** | the neighbouring ref-head ticket landed it (`840adbc6`, an ancestor of HEAD) |
| `CardCounters.ALL` (ref-property) | **already reads real state** | `441f7af7` ("read the Count$Valid $CardCounters.<KIND> summed property"), ancestor |
| `CardCounters.AGE` (ref-property) | **already reads real state** | AGE is a REAL counter kind: `rules/cumulative.go:268` emits `CounterChange Counter:"AGE"`, so `o.Counter("AGE")` answers |
| `CardNumColors` (ref-property) | **zero — genuinely missing** | no case in `evalRefProperty` |
| `LifeTotal` (player ref) | **zero — genuinely missing** | `evalPlayerRefProperty`'s ref switch does not know `TriggeredTarget`/`TriggeredPlayer`/`TriggeredDefendingPlayer` |

So the brief's list was stale for three of five. The genuinely-open work was
`CardNumColors` and `LifeTotal`, and that is what I implemented. The probe
test for the already-working three is kept as coverage (it passes both with
and without my change; it is evidence they were never the gap).

### `effects/count.go`

1. **`evalRefProperty`, new `case prop == "CardNumColors"`** — adds
   `int32(len(h.ObjectColors(o)))` per referenced object. `h.ObjectColors` is
   the SAME read the plain `Count$CardNumColors` head uses (live layer-5
   colours on the battlefield, the printed face elsewhere, including the LKI
   snapshot the loop already swaps in), so the two spellings cannot disagree.
   Corpus carriers: `Lurking Spinecrawler`, `Moonveil Regent`, `Mana Cannons`
   (`TriggeredCard$CardNumColors` / `Targeted$CardNumColors`).

2. **`evalPlayerRefProperty` default ref case** — the hand-list ref switch now
   falls through to `effects/context.go`'s shared `definedSpec` resolver (the
   same resolver a `Defined$` spelling goes through) and keeps its player
   entries. This is the structural fix the dispatch asks for: the next
   `Defined$`-resolved player ref is covered without editing a second list.
   **The property is confined to `LifeTotal`** (the one player head this
   ticket names), so the wider ref set cannot silently widen the family's
   other player count semantics. The `/Op` suffix is cut before the switch so
   the gate can inspect the bare property.
   Corpus carriers now correct: `TriggeredTarget$LifeTotal` (13 files —
   Quietus Spike, Ebonblade Reaper), `TriggeredPlayer$LifeTotal` (1),
   `TriggeredDefendingPlayer$LifeTotal` (1).

### `internal/testutil/agentsdoc_test.go`

`knownApproximationRows` **22 → 21**, comment updated, because this ticket
deletes the drained rv2b row (see below).

### `AGENTS.md`

Deleted the `(rv2b)` "Three fail-closed damage remainders" row by its text
(NOT renumbered). Both siblings are ancestors of HEAD on this branch:
`cli-20260923T060000Z-rv2b-damagesource` (`2acd1d4d`) and
`cli-20260923T060000Z-rv2b-validplayers` (`dbe11453`), and their commit
subjects name their sub-shapes, so the whole row is closed. Verified with
`git merge-base --is-ancestor`.

### `effects/count_ref_property_rv2b_test.go` (new)

All new tests live in a NEW ticket-named file (per the "new tests go in a new
file" rule). Covers: the object `CardNumColors` head (`Remembered$`,
`Targeted$` spellings), the player `LifeTotal` head (plain and `/HalfUp`,
`TriggeredDefendingPlayer`), plus the three already-working heads
(`CardCounters.AGE`/`.ALL`, `CastTotalManaSpent`) as regression coverage, and
two REAL-corpus tests reading the compiled SVars of **Moonveil Regent** and
**Quietus Spike**.

## Gates run (real output pasted)

Targeted acceptance test (brief's acceptance shape):

```
$ go test -run 'TestRefProperty' ./effects/
ok  	github.com/adams-shaun/gorge/effects	0.605s
```

Full package I edited (once, at the end):

```
$ go test ./effects/
ok  	github.com/adams-shaun/gorge/effects	3.412s
```

agentsdoc ratchet (row count now 21):

```
$ go test -run 'TestKnownApproximation' ./internal/testutil/
ok  	github.com/adams-shaun/gorge/internal/testutil	(cached)
```

Behaviour goldens outside `rules/` (run once, before reporting):

```
$ go test ./internal/archtest/
ok  	github.com/adams-shaun/gorge/internal/archtest	3.437s

$ go test -run TestConstructedDefaultIsByteIdentical ./cmd/botbench/
ok  	github.com/adams-shaun/gorge/cmd/botbench	1.161s
```

Lint Go half:

```
$ gofmt -l effects/count.go effects/count_ref_property_rv2b_test.go internal/testutil/agentsdoc_test.go
(no output)
$ go run ./cmd/gentypes -check
(no output, exit 0)
```

Corpus present (a green run is not a skipped one): `ls .cards | head` is
non-empty and the corpus-backed tests took 0.6s (a skipped run is ~2ms), so
the corpus was really exercised.

Heads / ratchets: the botbench 20-game split is byte-identical, so no re-pin
is needed; **TestHeads was NOT run in-seat** (daemon gate — the brief says
skip it), so this report does not claim chain-head movement in either
direction. One ratchet moved: `knownApproximationRows` 22 → 21, the rv2b row
deletion.

## Fails without the fix

I backed `effects/count.go` up (`cp`), restored HEAD's version over it
(`git show HEAD:effects/count.go`), ran the one test, and restored the fixed
file byte-identically (`cmp` confirmed). No `git stash`, no
`git checkout <path>`.

```

The `CardCounters` / `CastTotalManaSpent` tests in the same file PASS with the
fix reverted — they are regression coverage for already-working heads, not the
fix, and are labelled as such.

Each new test asserts its own precondition: the referenced card is
three-colour (and the source is not), the two players' life totals differ,
the fixture carries 3 AGE + 2 P1P1 counters, the other fixture carries 0, the
referred object carries no cast spend. A vacuous setup fails loudly.

## Deviations from the brief, with reasons

1. **`LifeTotal` is implemented in `evalPlayerRefProperty`, not literally in
   `evalRefProperty`.** `evalRefProperty`'s object loop `continue`s every
   `IsPlayer` target and its property switch is object-only, so a player
   `LifeTotal` structurally cannot live there. `evalPlayerRefProperty` is the
   family's designated player-valued half; the brief's "in `evalRefProperty`"
   names the family, and the code comment says where it actually landed.

2. **The player-ref property is confined to `LifeTotal`.** I resolved the REF
   structurally (shared `definedSpec`, so no second hand-list) but gated the
   property, because activating the other already-implemented player heads
   (`TriggeredTarget$CardsInHand`, `$Valid`, `$Counters.Poison`,
   `$LifeLostThisTurn`, …) would be "a global count semantic" change beyond
   the brief's named heads. See Issues for the residual.

3. **I initially overwrote the tracked shared test file
   `effects/count_ref_property_test.go`** (its `TestRefPropertyCounts` asserts
   `TriggeredTarget$LifeTotal == 0`, pinned by an earlier ticket). I caught
   this, restored the file byte-for-byte from HEAD, and moved all my tests to
   the new `effects/count_ref_property_rv2b_test.go`. The final diff touches
   NO shared test file (`git status` shows only the new file, untracked at
   first, plus the four changed files). The existing `TestRefPropertyCounts`
   still passes unchanged — its fixture binds `TriggeredTarget` to object
   targets, so `LifeTotal` is legitimately 0 there. Its comment ("An unknown
   ref or property stays zero") is now slightly imprecise for that one line,
   but the value is unchanged and I did not edit a shared file to reword it.

## Open concerns

- The `LifeTotal` gate (`prop != "LifeTotal"`) is a deliberate scope fence.
  If a future ticket drains the rest of the player-ref property family it
  should replace the gate with the full table, not add another fence.
- Botbench is byte-identical, so no re-pin is needed; TestHeads is unmeasured
  in-seat (daemon gate).

## Issues (defects found, not fixed)

1. **The rest of the player-ref `<Ref>$<Property>` family is still zero for
   the `Defined$`-resolved refs.** `TriggeredPlayer$CardsInHand` (10 corpus
   files), `TriggeredTarget$CardsInHand` (4), `TriggeredTarget$Valid` (3),
   `TriggeredDefendingPlayer$CardsInHand` (2), `TriggeredDefendingPlayer$CardsInLibrary` (2),
   `TriggeredCardController$ValidGraveyard` (2), `TriggeredTarget$Counters.Poison` (2),
   `TriggeredTarget$LifeLostThisTurn`, `TriggeredTarget$CardsInLibrary`,
   `TriggeredDefendingPlayer$ValidExile`, `TriggeredCardController$Valid`,
   `TriggeredTarget$Counters.RAD` (1 each). The readers all exist in
   `evalPlayerRefProperty`; they are unreachable only because the ref gate is
   confined to `LifeTotal` (deviation 2). A one-line lift of the gate would
   close them, but that is a wider count-semantic change than this ticket
   authorizes and needs its own ticket + botbench measurement. File/func:
   `effects/count.go` `evalPlayerRefProperty` (the `default:` ref case).
   A CR-lane test citing CR 107.3 / 608.2 (a count over a referenced player)
   would make this visible to the ledger.

2. **`PlayerCountRemembered$LifeTotal` (14 corpus files) is entirely
   unimplemented.** `PlayerCountRemembered` appears nowhere outside tests in
   `effects/`/`rules/` (`grep -rn 'PlayerCountRemembered' effects rules` →
   none). Same for `PlayerCountDefinedTriggeredSourceController$LifeTotal`,
   `PlayerCountDefinedTriggeredCardOwner$LifeTotal`,
   `PlayerCountDefinedActivePlayer$LifeTotal` (1 file each). This is the
   `PlayerCount<group>$<property>` head family, a different head from this
   ticket's `<Ref>$<Property>`, so out of scope. It deserves its own ticket;
   a CR-lane test citing CR 107.3 would surface it.

3. **`effects/count_ref_property_test.go`'s comment** labels
   `TriggeredTarget$LifeTotal` under "An unknown ref or property stays zero".
   The ref/property is no longer unknown; the value is 0 only because that
   fixture binds `TriggeredTarget` to object targets. Cosmetic; left as-is to
   avoid editing a shared file.
