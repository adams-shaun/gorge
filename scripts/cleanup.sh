# seat-cache: ds4-harness's pi-agent launcher gives every run a private,
# writable copy of ~/.pi at ~/.cache/pi-agent/<name>/.pi (rm -rf + cp -a at
# launch), so a finished seat's directory is pure leftover (~24 MB each,
# thousands of them). Transcripts are NOT here -- they live in the worktree's
# .ds4/pi-sessions. Kept: any directory a running process names (in its
# cmdline or as its cwd), and anything modified in the last MIN_AGE minutes
# (default 30), which covers a launch between its rm and its bwrap bind.
#
# worktrees: removes .worktrees/<id> when its branch is an ancestor of main,
# it has no tracked changes and no untracked (non-ignored) files, and no
# running process has its cwd inside it; then deletes the merged branch with
# `git branch -d`. Ignored run output (.ds4/, bin/) goes with the worktree --
# copy anything you want to keep first. Never forces, never touches main's
# checkout, and never uses pkill/pgrep -f: processes are read from /proc.
