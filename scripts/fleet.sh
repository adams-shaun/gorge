# --- liveness ---------------------------------------------------------------
# A seat is a CLAIM. A claim is not a running agent: an agent that finished or
# crashed used to hold its seat forever and cap the pool for nothing. So a seat
# now records WHICH PROCESS it is for, and liveness is read from the process
# table -- never from a file's mtime. A transcript's mtime says when it was
# last written, not whether the writer still exists.
#
# Identity is (pid, start time), not pid alone: pids are recycled, and after a
# recycle a bare `kill -0` on the old number says "alive" about a process that
# has nothing to do with the agent. /proc/<pid>/stat field 22 is the process's
# start time in clock ticks since boot -- fixed for the process's whole life,
# unforgeable by it, and different for whatever later inherits the number. It
# is preferred over cmdline, which a process can rewrite and which is identical
# across sibling agents anyway.
#
# NOTHING here signals a process. Existence is a read of /proc/<pid>/stat;
# `kill -0` on a specific numeric pid is the only other permitted probe. A
# cmdline PATTERN (`pkill -f`, bare `pgrep -f`) must never appear in this file:
# the pattern matches the searching process's own cmdline and has already
# killed a session on this box.
