// it (or its IDs/Pairs/Choices) in place would desync Head from HeadAt, so
// the engine never does. Because nothing writes to the shared region, both
// logs can read it freely. The full-slice expressions below are the point:
// each fixes cap == len, so the first append on EITHER side allocates a
// fresh array and the two logs diverge cleanly, never writing into the
// other's storage (pinned by TestLogCloneAppendsDiverge). buf is a scratch
// buffer reused only by Append, so a clone starts from nil and gets its own
// backing on first use — sharing it could race two append paths. Sharing
// here is what keeps memory-profile hot: ViewAt clones per time-travel query
// and Engine.Clone per turn-start snapshot, and a deep copy of an ever-
// growing log was ~17 GB of allocated space in the host test.

// Reserve grows the Events backing array's CAPACITY to at least n events,
// leaving length and every stored event untouched. It is an expected-size
// hint: a caller who knows a real match runs to roughly n events (host caps
// intents and can name a bound just above a real match's length) preallocates
// once so the log's common growth path never reallocates -- growEvents then
// charges a single make at Reserve time instead of a whole doubling series as
// the log climbs. Appends beyond n fall back to growEvents's doubling exactly
// as before, so a bad (too-small) hint only costs one extra growth, never a
// wrong result. It is a pure capacity hint and touches no chain state, so it
// is safe to call at any point (including after appends, e.g. host right after
// rules.New has written genesis): it reallocates the backing array once and
// copies existing events, and because stored Events are append-only history no
// one holds a reference to the old backing array to be invalidated. Clone
// safety is unchanged: Clone still fixes c.Events = l.Events[:len:len], so a
// clone never inherits reserved spare capacity and the first append on either
// side reallocates and the two logs diverge (pinned by
// TestLogReserveDoesNotLeakSpareCapacityToClone).

// growEvents grows the backing array geometrically, then returns s with len ==
// need. It replaces the built-in append's growth in one way: it doubles
// (factor 2) while the target stays small, and tapers to 1.25x past
// growTaperAt. Why: a fresh log climbs from cap 16 to its final length and
// doubling is the lowest-total-allocation policy there (a geometric series to
// a final capacity C sums to ~2C for factor 2, ~4C for factor 1.25), so small
// logs double. But most of growEvents' allocation is a log that a Clone made
// cap == len at a fully-grown length L and then appended to — a time-travel
// view replays into a clone of the live log; the first append must copy L
// elements and the doubling rule would allocate 2L (a 73823-event log jumps to
// 147456) for a replay that lands a few events past head. Tapering past
// growTaperAt makes that first grow cost ~1.25L instead, which is the measured
// win in ./host (growEvents was the top allocator; the large-start grows that
// doubling saddled with 2x dominate it 9:1). It returns s with len == need,
// whether in place or in a freshly-allocated array, so the ordinary no-realloc
// Append path costs nothing. Growth never overshoots need by more than the
// taper factor at any single step and always bounds the total, and the policy
// change does not touch the hash chain. Clone safety is untouched: Clone has
// already fixed a clone's cap == len, so the first append on either side
// arrives here with no spare capacity, allocates a fresh array, and the two
// logs diverge cleanly (pinned by TestLogCloneAppendsDiverge).
