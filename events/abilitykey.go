// ResolvedAbilityKey identifies "this ability" for Forge's
// Count$ResolvedThisTurn -- the per-ability resolution tally that gates
// Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER's "if this is the fourth time this ability has
// resolved this turn, transform" (and Prowl's, Victor's, Nissa's, ...).
//
// The key is (source permanent ObjID, the resolving root Ability$ body's
// CONTENT), never a *cards.SA pointer: cards.Link resolves an Execute$ SVar
// body by PARSING THE TEXT FRESH, so one card's two T: lines that share an
// Execute$ (Victor, Valgavoth's Seneschal's ChangesZone and FullyUnlock lines
// both Execute$ TrigSurveil) carry two structurally-equal but pointer-distinct
// SAs -- and a recorded log re-parses the body a third time. Content therefore
// is the only identity that merges the abilities the oracle calls one, and it
// is stable across a live game and its replay because the script text is
// static. The walk is a fixed pre-order with sorted parameter names, so it
// never depends on map iteration order.
//
// source is part of the key because two permanents can carry the same body
// (two Sephiroths, or a Sephiroth and a copied one) and each has its own tally.
