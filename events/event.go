	// FlipFace changes an object's active face. Task 18's SetState primitive
	// is the only source of this event. Appended here rather than inserted

	FlipFace
	// ClockTick advances Game.Clock by one. Ruling T19-a: rules.AddContinuous
	// used to increment g.Clock with a direct field write to stamp a
	// zero-Timestamp ContinuousEffect, the same bug class Ruling T11-a fixed

	// that advances Clock outside Apply leaves every later Timestamp off by
	// one in a fresh reconstruction folded from the log alone. AddContinuous
	// now emits this and reads the result instead of writing Clock itself.
	// It carries no fields: the tick's only effect is the increment, so
	// nothing else needs to survive the encode/decode round trip. Appended

	// so every earlier Kind's numeric value, the hash chain, and any golden
	// replay already locked in are unaffected.
	ClockTick
	// TriggerPush creates a triggered ability's stack object and places it
	// on the stack, in one event. Ruling T20-a: a live rules.Engine used to
	// mint this object with a direct, unlogged Game.AddObject call and then
	// emit a plain MoveZone naming its (already-assigned) ObjID -- but a log
	// replayed with no Engine behind it never learns that ID exists, so
	// events.Move's "if o == nil { return }" guard silently no-ops and the
	// replayed stack permanently diverges from the live one. This event
	// carries what Apply needs to recreate the object itself: Player is its
	// controller, Obj is the permanent whose trigger fired (Object.Source),
	// Amount is that permanent's Face().Triggers index (so Apply re-derives
	// the *cards.SA to run -- a raw pointer cannot be logged, only the data
	// that lets it be found again), and IDs is the triggering event's
	// Remembered object(s). No new Event field was added: Player/Obj/Amount/
	// IDs already exist and are reused, exactly as the brief's Ruling
	// requires, so the hash chain and every earlier golden replay are
	// unaffected by this Kind's own shape -- only its ordinal, appended here
	// after ClockTick, is new.
	TriggerPush
	// EndCombatReset clears every object's IsAttacking/BlockedBy fields
	// when Obj is zero. Nonzero Obj removes only that permanent from combat,
	// retaining zero blocker-list tombstones so attackers stay blocked.
	// Ruling T21-e (Task 21 fix round 1): rules.setStep used to do this with
	// a direct loop over e.G.Objs when entering StepEndCombat or
	// StepCleanup, instead of emitting anything -- a violation of "all state
	// mutation goes through events.Apply" that was structurally present
	// before Task 21 but stayed inert (IsAttacking/BlockedBy were never
	// actually set to a non-zero value by anything) until real combat made
	// it observable: a log-only reconstruction, having never been told
	// combat ended, kept a surviving attacker/blocker marked IsAttacking/
	// BlockedBy forever, while the live game correctly cleared both.

	// 4. Since the paid-{X} Ctx binding (CR 107.3i), commitCast's ability arm
	// also emits it on the AbilityPush-minted stack object to record the {X}

	// object, never the source permanent -- so Amount's meaning is "the {X}
	// value paid for this cast or activation". Appended here, after

	// replay is affected.
	CastInfo

	Choose
	// TokenCreate mints a token onto the battlefield. Player is its owner

	// StackCopy duplicates the spell or ability named by Obj (which must

	AbilityPush
	// ModeChosen records a KModes answer: spell announcement (CR 601.2b),
	// triggered-ability placement (CR 603.3c), or a mid-resolution mode or
	// unless-pay choice. Obj is the stack object, Player the chooser, and Text
	// the chosen option labels (csv, in execution order). It is a marker like
	// Note: the engine caches placement/announcement names or carries a
	// resolution answer in its continuation, while Apply remains inert. The
	// log lets replay re-derive the same branch. Appended
	// here, after AbilityPush, following every prior Kind's own append-only
	// precedent, so no earlier ordinal, hash chain or golden replay is
	// affected (M2d-2).
	ModeChosen
	// CmdDamage records a commander dealing combat damage to a player (CR
	// 903.10, Task m33). Player is the damaged player, Obj the source
	// commander (whose Object ID is stable across zone moves), and Amount
	// the damage that actually landed (prevented/replaced damage is never
	// emitted). events.Apply folds it into that player's cumulative
	// commander-damage tally (state.Player.CmdDamage), keyed by the source
	// commander's match-wide dense index derived from g.Players[].Commanders.
	// Carried as a dedicated event rather than derived from the existing
	// Damage events because those do not record which commander the source
	// was -- this event is what lets a reconstruction starting from the log
	// alone rebuild the per-commander tally. Appended after ModeChosen,
	// following every prior Kind's append-only precedent, so no earlier
	// ordinal, hash chain or golden replay is affected. Only ever emitted in
	// a Commander-format game.
	CmdDamage
	// DelayedRegister records a delayed-trigger registration (CR 603.7,
	// effects.effDelayedTrigger's Mode$ Phase branch). A delayed trigger is
	// registered during one resolution and fires later -- in general a
	// different turn -- so the registration is game state, folded here into
	// state.Game.Delayed so a log-only replay rebuilds the same set. Event
	// field reuse: Obj is the source object (whose face's SVar table carries
	// the Execute$ ability), Player the controller, Step the phase to fire
	// in, Counter the Execute$ SVar name, IDs the Remembered object(s)
	// captured at registration (PlayerRef-encoded, as TriggerPush does), and
	// Text the Forge Phase$ string for description -- or, for an event-matched
	// (non-phase) registration, "<Mode$ value>:<trigger SVar name>", the
	// encoding events.Apply's DelayedRegister case decodes into
	// state.DelayedTrigger's EventMode/Trigger pair. Appended here, after
	// CmdDamage, following every prior Kind's own append-only precedent, so
	// no earlier ordinal, hash chain or golden replay is affected.
	DelayedRegister
	// DelayedPush mints a delayed triggered ability's stack object and fires
	// it -- the "goes on the stack like any other triggered ability" half of
	// a Mode$ Phase delayed trigger, created when the registered phase is
	// entered. It is a sibling of TriggerPush/AbilityPush and exists for the
	// same reason (Ruling T20-a): the ability object is minted inside Apply,
	// so a log-only replay creates the exact object a live game did. Unlike
	// TriggerPush (whose Ability re-derives from a face Triggers index), a
	// delayed trigger's Ability is an SVar-named sub-ability on the source's
	// face, so the Execute$ name is carried in Counter and Apply resolves it
	// via cards.ResolveSVar. Obj is the source, Player the controller,
	// Amount the registration's ID (state.DelayedTrigger.ID) so Apply can
	// remove exactly the registration it fired, and IDs the Remembered
	// objects (PlayerRef-encoded). Firing is one-shot: Apply's case both
	// mints the object and drops the registration. Appended after
	// DelayedRegister, following every prior Kind's append-only precedent.
	DelayedPush
	// LibraryOrder records a player having set a complete new order on
	// their library -- the state change behind a library-arranging effect
	// (RearrangeTopOfLibrary, Ponder; later Scry/Surveil/Dig) and the
	// discard half of a bottoming ask. Player names whose library, IDs the
	// COMPLETE new order (the top cards reordered, then the untouched
	// remainder beneath them). Secret is always true: the exact order of a
	// hidden zone must not leak to another seat, so view redaction drops the
	// payload for anyone but Player.
	//
	// Appended here, after DelayedPush, following the named precedents of
	// TargetsChosen (Ruling T14-b), FlipFace (T18-a) and ClockTick (T19-a)
	// rather than inserted anywhere earlier, so every earlier Kind's numeric
	// value, and therefore the hash chain and every golden replay already
	// locked in, is unaffected.
	LibraryOrder
	// ExtraTurn records one grant or consumption of an extra turn (CR
	// 500.7). Player is the seat the turn belongs to and Amount the delta:
	// an api:AddTurn effect emits +NumTurns$, and the turn structure (rules
	// advanceStep) emits -1 exactly when it hands that seat a repeat turn
	// instead of moving to the next living seat. The state
	// (state.Game.ExtraTurns) is folded here, so a log-only reconstruction
	// arrives at the same pending counts the live game held. When the
	// granting ability carries Forge's ExtraTurnDelayedTrigger$ (Final
	// Fortune's "At the beginning of that turn's end step, you lose the
	// game"), Counter names the Execute$ SVar and Obj the granting source,
	// and this case ALSO registers the delayed trigger for the extra turn's
	// end step: a delayed registration whose MinTurn is the extra turn's
	// number (g.Turn+1 at grant time), so the ordinary delayed-trigger
	// firing skips the CURRENT turn's end step and fires exactly once, in
	// the granted turn. Appended here, after LibraryOrder, following every
	// prior Kind's append-only precedent, so no earlier ordinal, hash chain
	// or golden replay is affected.
	ExtraTurn
	// DoorUnlock records the unlock of an Enchantment Room's locked door
	// (CR 309.5): the player paid the locked half's mana cost as a sorcery.
	// Obj is the room permanent; Apply sets its Unlocked flag, which makes
	// the alternate face's rules text live (rules' trigger/static/ability
	// scans) and is what a Mode$ UnlockDoor trigger matches against. The
	// unlock trigger itself is queued rules-side on this event (rules
	// checkTriggers), so this event is the whole state delta. Appended
	// after ExtraTurn, same append-only precedent.
	DoorUnlock
	// SpeedChange records one increment of a seat's speed (CR 702.163,
	// "Start your engines!"). Player is the seat whose speed rises and
	// Amount the delta (always +1 today; the engine caps the grant at max
	// speed 4 and at once per turn before ever emitting). Folded into
	// state.Player.Speed here, so a reconstruction rebuilds it. Appended
	// after DoorUnlock, same append-only precedent.
	SpeedChange
	// MonarchChange gives the designation to Player. It is a state transition,
	// not a Note, so conditional "if you're the monarch" triggers replay from
	// the same state as the live match. Appended after LibraryOrder to preserve
	// every prior event ordinal.
	MonarchChange
	// ControlChange transfers control of a permanent or a stack object. Obj is
	// the controlled object and Player its new controller. It is deliberately a
	// distinct event: control is neither ownership nor a zone change, and a
	// replay must retain it when the object later moves.
	ControlChange
	// CardToken mints a battlefield token that is a copy of the card object Obj
	// names. Appending after main's existing events preserves their ordinals.
	CardToken
	// KeywordTriggerPush mints a mandatory keyword-provided triggered ability.
	KeywordTriggerPush
	// Goad applies CR 701.38's attack requirement to Obj. Player is the
	// goading player, Text its Forge duration, IDs[0] its source, and Amount
	// the target's controller plus one. Amount -1 removes every relationship.
	Goad
	// PlayerCounterChange changes a counter on Player. Counter names the kind
	// and Amount the delta; Ward's AddCounterYou<.../POISON> is its first use.
	PlayerCounterChange
	// Imprint updates one source-card association. Obj is the source and IDs
	// are the cards to add: ordinary text is Forge's imprintedCards list,
	// Text "exiled-with" is its distinct exiledCards list, Text
	// "until-host-leaves" is ChangeZone's Duration$ UntilHostLeavesPlay
	// association (Amount carries the zone the cards were exiled from, which
	// their return moves them back to; rules sweepExileReturn consumes it),
	// and Text "clear" clears only imprintedCards. Reusing Text avoids
	// changing Event's layout.
	// It is append-only so prior event ordinals and replay hashes stay stable.
	Imprint
	// StartingPlayerChange records CR 103.1's starting-player designation.
	// It is emitted by genesis's toss resolution (folded without appending at
	// genesis, since genesis is replayed from Config) and by an opening-hand
	// effect such as Impatient Iguana, rather than being inferred from
	// TurnChange, because Count$StartingPlayer must read its result before
	// turn one. Appended after main's kinds so the merge preserves main's
	// ordinals (log.json serializes kind numerically; a committed fixture's
	// replay pins them).
	StartingPlayerChange
	// Pair records a Soulbond pairing (CR 702.103): Obj is the pairing
	// permanent and IDs[0] is its chosen partner. Appended after
	// StartingPlayerChange (the merge kept main's kinds at their main
	// ordinals), following the same append-only precedent, so all earlier
	// Kinds keep their numeric values and the hash chain and golden replays
	// are unaffected.
	Pair
	// MyriadCopy records one Myriad (CR 702.109) attacker token: a copy of
	// the attack-creature Obj that enters tapped and attacking the opponent
	// named by Player. Appended after Pair, same append-only precedent.
	MyriadCopy
	// MyriadCleanup exiles every Myriad token still on the battlefield as the
	// end-of-combat step ends (CR 702.109a). Its event-sourced arena scan keeps
	// live play and log replay in lockstep without adding one delayed trigger
	// per token.
	MyriadCleanup
	// GrantTriggerPush mints a static-grant's triggered ability (AddTrigger$
	// on a Mode$ Continuous static, e.g. Hearthhull's "STATION 8+ Whenever you
	// sacrifice a land") and places it on the stack, in one event. It mirrors
	// DelayedPush's shape -- the Ability is not a face Triggers index but the
	// granted trigger's Execute$ SVar-named body -- minus the registration
	// bookkeeping: a granted trigger is consumed by nothing and lives exactly
	// as long as its granting static. The Execute$ body lives on the GRANTOR's
	// face (the card carrying the static), while Obj is the AFFECTED
	// recipient; for a cross-object grant the grantor's object id rides
	// Amount, and Apply resolves the name from the grantor's SVar table when
	// it is set (0 = the historical self-grant shape, resolved from the
	// affected object's own table). Rules' queue gate links the body from the
	// same table, so a replay reproduces the same stack object. Appended after
	// MyriadCleanup, following every prior Kind's append-only precedent, so no
	// earlier ordinal, hash chain or golden replay is affected.
	GrantTriggerPush
	// ManaActivate records one activation of an AB$ Mana ability. It is a
	// MARKER like Note: effMana's own ManaAdd events carry the mana that
	// landed but never attribute it to a source object (Event.Obj is unset
	// on them), and populating it would re-encode every existing ManaAdd
	// event and move every golden replay -- so the marker, emitted only by
	// resolveManaAbility for abilities that actually carry an
	// ActivationLimit$ parameter (Vivi Ornitier's "only once each turn"),
	// is what lets rules' activationLimitReached event-log scan count mana
	// activations by source and ability index, the same way it already
	// counts AbilityPush for non-mana abilities. Obj is the source permanent,
	// Player the activator, Amount the ability's index in the face's
	// Abilities slice. A marker carrying IDs is a GAINED mana activation
	// (Forge's GainsAbilitiesOf$, rules' gainedManaRef): IDs[0] names the
	// FOREIGN card the ability belongs to and Amount indexes that card's face
	// Abilities, which is what the GainsAbilitiesLimitPerTurn$ cap counts; it
	// is emitted for every gained mana activation, limit or not, and the
	// printed-limit scan skips it. Appended here, after GrantTriggerPush, following every
	// prior Kind's own append-only precedent, so no earlier ordinal, hash
	// chain or golden replay is affected.
	ManaActivate
	// TokenAttacks marks an already-existing permanent that entered the
	// battlefield TAPPED AND ATTACKING (TokenAttacking$ or a move body's

	// object, Player its controller and IDs[0] the defender it attacks.
	// MyriadCopy must not be reused for this: it

	// is the stack object whose {X} was rewritten, Amount the new value. A
	// plain CastInfo could not carry this: its Apply case resets CastFlags
	// from Counter unconditionally (wiping Kicked/Flashback on a flagged X

	// into Object.NotedNumber for Count$NotedNumber to read at the later
	// ETB. A plain Note could not carry this: it is transcript text with no
	// numeric payload and no Apply behaviour, and the value must be

	// Card/FaceIdx always describe the top card and every under-card lands in
	// its MergedCards (top-of-pile first), each parked in ZCeased, and
	// TimesMutated advances by Amount. It is the provenance both the
	// trig:Mutates fire and Count$TimesMutated read, so a replay rebuilds the
	// pile identically. Appended here, after ClonePermanent -- the last Kind
	// main holds -- following every prior Kind's own append-only precedent,

	Mutate
	// MergedTriggerPush mints a mutated pile's UNDER-CARD triggered ability
	// (CR 702.140d: the permanent has all abilities of the cards beneath

	// face's own Triggers index) packed by MergedTriggerAmount, and IDs the
	// Remembered capture the ordinary trigger push encodes.
	//
	// Apply mints the ability from THAT face's own compiled trigger -- the
	// TriggerPush shape, f.Triggers[idx].Effect -- never from a by-name
	// SVar walk. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
	//   - the top face may define the same SVar name with a different body
	//     (Cubwarden and Everquill Phoenix both name their token SVar
	//     TrigToken), so a top-first by-name walk steals the under-card's
	//     body; and
	//   - cards.ResolveSVar parses a FRESH *SA on every call, so an ability
	//     minted that way has no pointer identity with the compiled
	//     cards.Trigger.Effect. Every consumer that recovers a resolving
	//     ability's owning trigger does so by that pointer
	//     (findTriggerForAbilityFace), so a fresh parse silently disabled
	//     the OptionalDecider$ gate, the intervening-if recheck, the
	//     ResolvedLimit$ count, the ability's label and the merged-face
	//     SVar table at resolution. Minting the compiled pointer is what
	//     makes an under-card trigger an ordinary trigger everywhere else.
	//
	// It is a sibling of DelayedPush/GrantTriggerPush -- the minting shape

	MergedTriggerPush
	// Discover records one completed discover action (CR 701.57, task

	// that precede this one, and the record is what trig:Discover matches
	// ("whenever you discover" -- Val, Marooned Surveyor, Curator of Sun's
	// Creation). The marker is ONE per completed discover action, never one
	// per exiled card. Appended after MergedTriggerPush, still after every
	// earlier Kind, so no earlier ordinal, hash chain or golden replay is
	// affected.
	Discover
	// Seek records one completed seek action (Forge's Alchemy seek, task
	// trigdisc1): Player is the seeking seat and Obj the resolving source
	// permanent (0 for a source-less body). It is an Apply no-op marker,
	// exactly like Discover, and is what trig:SeekAll matches ("whenever you
	// seek one or more cards" -- Vexyr, Ich-Tekik's Heir; Val, Marooned
	// Surveyor; Lurker in the Deep). One marker per seek ACTION, never one
	// per sought card -- a seek of three cards is one marker and one
	// trigger -- and the emitter's contract (api:Seek, still unimplemented)
	// is to emit only when the seek actually found at least one card, so the

	Seek
	// Connive records one completed connive action (CR 702.59, task connive1):

	// One marker per completed connive ACTION, never one per discarded card.
	// Appended after Seek, still after every earlier Kind, so no earlier
	// ordinal, hash chain or golden replay is affected.
	Connive
	// Enlist records one CR 702.160 enlist action (the `K:Enlist` keyword,
	// task enlist1): Obj is the ATTACKING creature that enlisted (the
	// trigger's source for Mode$ Enlisted, so ValidCard$ Card.Self matches
	// it) and IDs[0] the nonattacking creature it tapped, Player the
	// attacker's controller. Apply folds the per-combat stamp the
	// enlistedThisCombat filter predicate reads; the tap is its own Tap
	// event and the +X/+0 is a rules-registered continuous pump, so this
	// event is the enlist action's canonical record and the Mode$ Enlisted
	// trigger's carrier. Appended here, after Connive, following every prior

	// or golden replay is affected.
	Enlist
	// Exploit records one completed exploit sacrifice (CR 702.58a, task
	// exploit1): Obj is the EXPLOITING creature (the permanent whose exploit
	// ability resolved), Player its controller, IDs[0] the exploited creature
	// -- the one sacrificed to pay. It is an Apply no-op marker, exactly like
	// Explore/Investigate: the sacrifice's own state change (the
	// battlefield-to-graveyard MoveZone) is its own event that precedes this
	// one, and the record is what trig:Exploited matches ("Whenever a
	// creature you control exploits a creature", Colonel Autumn; "When
	// CARDNAME exploits a creature", Graf Reaver). A declined exploit
	// election records nothing at all -- CR 702.58a's "you may sacrifice a

	// following every prior Kind's own append-only precedent, so no earlier
	// ordinal, hash chain or golden replay is affected.
	Exploit
	// AlterAttribute records one Forge AlterAttribute application (task

	// the attribute name -- the engine models exactly one, "Suspected"
	// (CR 702.157, the Blame Game precon's Nelly Borca / Hot Pursuit
	// family) -- and Amount 1 grants it, -1 removes it (the Activate$ False
	// arm, Forge's "becomes unprepared" spelling). Apply folds the
	// designation; the two CR 702.157b end conditions -- the permanent
	// leaves the battlefield, another player gains control of it -- are the
	// Move and ControlChange folds' own clears, the same blocks the
	// Ring-bearer designation's clears live in. Appended here, after

	AlterAttribute
	// GainedAbilityPush creates the stack object for an activated ability
	// GAINED off a foreign card (Forge's GainsAbilitiesOf$ on a Mode$
	// Continuous static, the Idris, Soul of the TARDIS shape). Like
	// AbilityPush it mints inside Apply (Ruling T20-a) so a log-only replay
	// creates the same object a live game did, but the ability is not a
	// Face().Abilities index of the recipient: Obj is the recipient (the

	// IDs[0] is the FOREIGN card's object id, and Amount is the index of the
	// ability in that card's Face().Abilities. The body is the foreign
	// face's compiled SA, so a replay re-resolves the identical pointer (the
	// MergedTriggerPush reasoning: pointer identity is what the
	// activation-limit census and the owning-face SVar reads rely on). A
	// foreign card that left the scoped zone, or a stale index, mints
	// nothing. Appended here, after AlterAttribute, following every prior
	// Kind's own append-only precedent, so no earlier ordinal, hash chain or

	GainedAbilityPush
	// GainedTriggerPush creates the stack object for a triggered ability

	GainedTriggerPush
	// Surveil records one completed surveil instruction (CR 701.42, task

	// by api:Surveil (effects/cardflow.go effSurveil) before the arrangement
	// -- the trigger bodies queue and resolve after the surveil spell or

	// (main's own append while this branch carried Surveil after
	// AlterAttribute; the merge keeps main's ordinals intact and appends the

	Surveil
	// Unattached records an Aura/Equipment permanent Obj becoming detached

	// TurnFaceUp records a face-down battlefield permanent being turned face
	// up (CR 708.6 / CR 702.36e): Obj is the permanent. Apply clears its
