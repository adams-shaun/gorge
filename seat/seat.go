// Package seat is who answers the engine's decisions. It sits above rules in
// the dependency order (cards -> state -> decision -> events -> effects ->
// rules -> view -> seat -> replay -> cmd/*): a Seat is handed a view.View,
// never a *state.Game or a *rules.Engine, so it only ever sees what a real
// client would.
