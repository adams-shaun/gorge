// Bot is a deterministic policy with its own RNG, independent of the
// engine's (rules/rng.go), so a match is reproducible from (engine seed, bot
// seed). It picks from the options the engine offered and nothing else,
// which is the same contract a human client has (Ruling P8).
//
// The policy itself lives in botpolicy (botpolicy/policy.go), shared with
// the rules package's fuzz testBot (rules/testbot_test.go): rules cannot
// import seat without running the dependency order backwards (Ruling F7),
// so both sides build a botpolicy.Board from what they can see and call the
// same botpolicy.Decide. This file is the view-shaped half of that -- it
// converts the projected View into the Board and seeds the bot's own rng.
// There is no second copy of the policy to keep in step; seat/integration_test.go's
// TestBotAdaptersAgree* pins the two halves to the same Board for the same
// game facts.
