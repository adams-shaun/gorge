// TestBotReserveCountsJustPlayedLand is the CR 302.6 regression over the view
// adapter: the engine marks EVERY permanent summoning-sick on entry
// (events/apply.go sets o.SummonSick = true), but the tap-legality rule only
// refuses the tap cost when the derived types contain Creature and the
// permanent has no Haste (rules/legal.go). A basic land is never a creature,
// so a Forest played this turn is fully tappable for mana and MUST count
// toward the bot's coloured-instant reserve.
//
// The board is the claim-A shape with the reserve preserved: four live basic
// Forests (one of them just played, so the View carries SummonSick true), a
// {G}{G} instant the seat is holding, and a one-mana {G} burn pending on the
// stack. Four live sources survive both the pending payment and the
// single-unit probe, so the value kill (the 2/2 the three-damage burn can
// actually kill) must be promoted over the unkillable but board-first 5/5.
//
// This is the end-to-end guard for the wrong model a prior revision of the
// pending-payment fix shipped: treating a sick BASIC source as dead mana made
// the adapter hand the policy three live Forests instead of four and silently
// declined the value kill on the extremely common "play a land, then burn"
// turn. The precondition assertions below pin that the fresh source reaches
// the policy as a live basic Forest and that the two creature values differ,
// so a vacuous setup fails loudly rather than passing.
