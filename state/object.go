	FlagReplaceGraveyard
	// FlagAftermath marks a cast of a Split card's Aftermath alternate face

	// FlagMutated marks a spell cast for its Mutate cost (CR 702.140a). It is
	// the provenance rules/stack.go's resolution reader uses to merge the
	// spell's card into its target instead of moving it to the battlefield as
	// an ordinary permanent. FlagMutatedTop carries CR 702.140b's placement
	// choice (the mutating card goes on TOP of the target); its absence means
	// the mutating card goes UNDER. Both are set by the pay-time CastInfo the
	// cast's mutate-placement answer rides, so the choice is replay-derived.

	// FlagSquadPaid marks a cast that paid its Squad cost at least once
	// (CR 702.66): "As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may pay
	// [cost] any number of times." The payment COUNT rides the same
	// pay-time CastInfo's Amount into Object.SquadPaid, and the keyword
	// expansion's ETB trigger reads it through Count$SquadPaid to create
	// that many token copies. Appended per the enum's own append-only

	// FlagOffspringPaid marks a cast that paid its Offspring additional cost
	// (CR 702.175a): "You may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this
	// spell. If you do, when this creature enters, create a 1/1 token copy
	// of it." Offspring is paid at most once, so the provenance is a bool,
	// not a count: the keyword expansion's ETB trigger reads it through
	// Count$OffspringPaid to decide whether to mint the 1/1 copy. Appended
	// per the enum's own append-only precedent.

	// FlagOptionalCostPaid marks a self-spell OptionalCost additional cost.
	FlagOptionalCostPaid
	// FlagConvoked marks a cast whose pay-time CastInfo carries CR 702.66

	// the cast ride the event's IDs into Object.Convoked. The flag is what
	// Defined$ Convoked reads (Lethal Scheme's connive sub, Venerated
	// Loxodon's and Zephyr Singer's ETB triggers). Emitted only for a face
	// whose SVar table or abilities reference the selector (rules/cast.go's
	// faceWantsConvoked), so every unrelated convoke cast stays

	// FlagFused marks a Fuse cast (CR 702.101b) of a non-Room Split card:

	// rather than the single Face().SpellAbility(). Appended per the enum's
	// own append-only precedent.
	FlagFused
	// FlagManaExpendCast marks a cast whose pay-time CastInfo is the
	// trig:ManaExpend wake-up (the FlagManaSpent pattern): the Amount is the
	// mana the cast's payment spent (state.Mana pips summed), read by the
	// crossing matcher (rules/trigmatch_cast.go's manaExpendMatches). Emitted
	// only when a ManaExpend trigger face is on the casting player's
	// battlefield (rules/cast.go's manaExpendReaderOut), so every game without
	// a carrier stays byte-identical. The cumulative per-turn tally the
	// crossing is measured against is ENGINE SCRATCH, not this event: it must
	// include casts made before the carrier entered, which emit no event.
	// Appended per the enum's own append-only precedent.
	FlagManaExpendCast
	// FlagJumpstart marks a cast paid for with the card's Jump-start keyword
	// (CR 702.84a): the card was cast from the graveyard by discarding a
	// card in addition to paying its other costs. It is the provenance
	// rules/stack.go's resolution reader (spellRestZone) and fizzle reader
	// (spellFizzleZone) use to exile the card instead of the graveyard, both
	// on resolution and when countered. Appended per the enum's own

	// FlagMayFlashSac marks a spell cast off-sorcery through its K:MayFlashSac
	// permission (CR 702.8's "you may cast this as though it had flash" plus
	// the keyword's own "sacrifice it at the beginning of the next cleanup
	// step" rider). It is set by the pay-time CastInfo only when the cast was
	// NOT at a time a sorcery could have been cast, so the keyword's ETB hook
	// (rules/altcast.go's altCostEnter) can register the delayed sacrifice.
	// Appended per the enum's own append-only precedent.

	// FlagMayhem marks a cast paid for with the card's K:Mayhem alternative
	// cost (the Doom Prevails "may cast this card from your graveyard for
	// <cost> if you discarded it this turn" keyword): the flag is the
	// provenance the Card.CastSa Spell.Mayhem condition reads (Sandman's
	// Quicksand's "if this spell's mayhem cost was paid" split). Appended
	// per the enum's own append-only precedent.

	// FlagMorphed / FlagMegamorphed / FlagDisguised mark a face-down cast
	// paid for with the {3} morph-family alternative cost (CR 702.37a
	// Morph, 702.168a Megamorph, 702.169a Disguise). The flag names the

	// (rules/stack.go resolveTop) dispatches on the set to resolve the
	// spell with no printed spell abilities and no targets (CR 708.4),
	// rules/resolution.go's moveResolvedOffStack re-carries the face-down
	// entry marker so the permanent enters face down (CR 708.5), and a
	// later turn-face-up action reads the family to price its cost (the
	// printed keyword parameter, unchanged on the face). They shape the
