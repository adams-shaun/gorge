	MayPlayIgnoreType bool

	// ForgetOnMoved carries the Effect's ForgetOnMoved$ zone: a remembered

	ExileOnMoved string
	// ImprintOnHost marks a DB$ Effect registration whose SA carried
	// ImprintOnHost$ True: Forge's EffectEffect imprints the CREATED EFFECT
	// TOKEN on the host card and moves the token to the Command zone -- the
	// imprint is the link "this effect belongs to this card", never the

	// another card" lifetime -- and Word of Command / Semester's End use the

	// EndImprintedEffect. Engine-runtime only, rebuilt by re-execution on

	// ForgetCounter carries the Effect's ForgetCounter$ counter kind (task

	// whose count of that kind reaches zero after a counter-removal leaves
	// the effect's Remembered set -- "for as long as it has a vow counter
	// on it". The count DROPPING without reaching zero keeps the card (the

	// restriction only when its LAST such counter goes). Engine-runtime
	// only, rebuilt by re-execution on replay like every other
	// continuous-effect field.
	ForgetCounter string

	// ForgetOnCast carries the Effect's ForgetOnCast$ spec (task

	// over the cast spell, You-relative to the effect's controller, matched
	// by rules' effectCastSweep at the deferred re-walk of the cast's
	// PutOnStack (payCast, after payment) -- so an ABORTED proposal (one
	// reversed before payment, CR 733.1) never consumes the grant while a
	// completed cast, even one later countered, does. Empty means the

	// AdjustLandPlays marks an additional-land-drops grant (Azusa, Lost but

	// CloneTarget marks a continuous effect created by an api:Clone copy

	// drops the marker on the marker's own duration and removes every
