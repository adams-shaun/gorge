# smoke is the browser smoke gate (Task SG1, extended by ui19): it builds the

# -spectator public (the mode that was broken when a null hand spread into
# the board killed every table page, and the one the omniscient-only unit
# fixtures cannot see), one -spectator omniscient, and one SEATED 1v1
# play-vs-bot server (-vsbot -humans 1, Task ui19) — on smoke ports in
# 8090-8099, and drives the headless-browser test at web/e2e against all
# three. It fails on any pageerror, any console.error, any failed request to
# the server's own origin, a page still in its loading state after a bounded
# wait, or a blank page that never mounts. It also asserts the SEATED layout
# invariants ui19 was added for: the seated player's own identity bar does
# not overlap their own hand fan, and the hand fan stays bounded by the
# board (never self-sizing straight off it). scripts/smoke.sh owns
# starting/stopping the set and removing their temp dirs on failure (a leaked
# gorged poisons the next run).
#
# Deliberately NOT part of `make test`. The Go suite must stay runnable with
# no browser and no live servers; threading smoke into the default tree would
