// This file is the server-side half of the feedback capture (task
// fbrepro1): when a player files a bug report naming a table, the report
// must carry enough to reproduce the match they were in — because the
// event log a deploy wipes is the one thing a later retelling loses. The
// shapes here are what Registry.SnapshotForFeedback hands the caller
// (cmd/gorged's feedback store), which marshals them beside the report.

// FeedbackMatch is match.json's content: the sidecar of the table's current
// match — the same fields host/persist.go persists, in the same shape —
// plus DeckCards, the deck CONTENTS (card name per card, in deck order,
// one list per seat). The sidecar's Decks names deck FILES, which a deploy
// can change under an old snapshot; DeckCards is what a replay is actually
// built from, so the snapshot never depends on the deck files still
// existing. The fields mirror sidecar's on purpose: a test pins that the
// two marshal the same keys, so the snapshot cannot drift from the
// persisted shape without failing.

	// Tokens carries the raw token scripts — keyed by file stem, the exact

	// rules.Config.Tokens. rules.Config.Tokens is replay input (rules.New
	// copies it onto Game.Tokens, and events.Apply's TokenCreate case mints
	// from it), so a replay rebuilt from match.json alone needs it exactly
	// as it needed the deck contents: without it, the replayed engine's
	// effToken emits an "unknown token script" Note where the log records a
	// TokenCreate, and the replay diverges at that event.
	//
	// The scripts are shipped as text, not as compiled cards, because a
	// compiled *cards.Card cannot survive a JSON round trip: its derived
	// P/T, CMC and colour-identity fields are unexported (cards/ir.go), so
	// a JSON decode would leave them zero — a 1/1 Goblin replayed as a 0/0.
	// A token Card IS fully determined by its script text, and the repro
	// tool recompiles each entry with cards.ParseBytes + Card.Link +
	// ApplyIntrinsics — the exact pipeline compileScripts runs the corpus
	// through — so the rebuilt cards are the ones the match played with.
	//
	// The whole cfg.Tokens is captured, not only the tokens some deck seems
	// to reference: the engine never enumerates which tokens a deck can
	// create (TokenScript$ reaches effToken through spell abilities,
	// triggers, replacements, keyword expansions and SVar bodies alike), so
	// any filtered capture could miss an indirect creator and reproduce the
	// very unknown-token divergence this field exists to prevent. The whole

	// or a synthetic token compiled from bytes with no file behind it) is
