"""gorge's agentctl hooks: what `.agentctl/config.toml` cannot say as a value.

Loaded by agentctl from this FILE (agentctl.pipeline.hooks.resolve), not
imported as `orchestrator.hooks`, so it must stay self-contained: standard
library only, no `from orchestrator import ...`. Canonical copy lives in
agentctl `consumers/gorge/hooks.py`; the controller copies it here and
agentctl's tests/test_consumer_parity.py pins it against the 2026-09-19
