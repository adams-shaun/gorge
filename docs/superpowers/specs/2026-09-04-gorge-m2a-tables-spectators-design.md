# gorge M2a — tables and spectators

Date: 2026-09-04. Status: approved in brainstorm; ready for a plan.
Parent: `2026-09-03-mtgcore-go-engine-design.md` (engine) and
`2026-09-04-gorge-post-m1-roadmap.md` (sequence). Design evidence: the UI
survey `ui-inspiration.md` (recommendations 23–33 shape the client), the
mtgplay/mtgserve interface comparison, and the ui-fix history — all three are
evidence of needs, not contracts.

## Problem

The engine plays complete 4-player games headless and replays them
byte-identically, but nobody can watch one. The next thing the project needs
is a match host that keeps tables running and a browser client that lets a
person watch several tables at once, focus on one, and rewind it — without
the engine learning anything about clocks, sockets or browsers. M2a builds
exactly that, on bot-only tables. A human at a seat is M2b.

## Goals

- `gorged` runs N tables of 4 bots on the repo decks, paced for humans, and
  restarts each table with a fresh match when one ends.
- A spectator sees an overview of every table, focuses one, and gets the
  whole board (omniscient on bot tables), the stack, the pending-trigger
  tray, a rules transcript, and card images.
- A spectator pauses their own view, steps event by event in either
  direction, scrubs by turn, and returns to live — while the match keeps
  running.
- Late joiners and reconnects are backfilled; finished matches are replayable
  after a `gorged` restart.
- The `host` package is importable by mtgserve without `gorged`.
- The Go module stays stdlib-only. The browser client holds no rules
  knowledge.

## Non-goals

- Human seats, intents, mulligans, priority UI (M2b).
- Accounts, authentication, persistence beyond files on disk (M2c). The host
  exposes an authorizer hook; `gorged` allows everyone.
- Commander (M2d). Pausing the match itself (a pace control is a later
  message type if ever wanted).
- Resume of an in-progress match across a restart (M5).
- WebSocket, protobuf, any non-stdlib server dependency.

## Decisions

Numbering continues the engine spec's D1–D8.

### D9. Host is a library plus a thin binary

`host` is an importable package: table registry, match loop, sessions,
subscriptions, persistence. `cmd/gorged` wraps it with `net/http`, flags and
the embedded web build. mtgserve imports `host` in-process at M2c; a separate
service was rejected because one binary is the project goal and the engine's
one-goroutine-per-match rule already isolates matches from each other.

### D10. Transport is SSE downstream and POST upstream (amends engine D5)

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **SSE + POST (chosen)** | `net/http` only; `EventSource` reconnects and resends `Last-Event-ID` by itself; survives every proxy; trivially debuggable with `curl` | Two channels to correlate — solved by carrying the decision `seq` in every POST |
| WebSocket | One channel; lower latency for rapid priority round-trips | Needs a handshake and framing implementation or a dependency; reconnect and backfill are hand-rolled |

Spectating is one-directional and even the M2b player seat exchanges one
intent per decision, so the round-trip argument for WebSocket has no measured
weight yet. The envelope is transport-agnostic; a WebSocket adapter can be
added beside the SSE one without changing a frame.

### D11. Spectator pause is a client-side DVR cursor with server-side view-at-seq

The match never pauses. Each client holds a cursor into the match's event
log. The server keeps turn-start snapshots per live match and answers
"view at seq N" by replaying at most one turn of events from the nearest
snapshot (the `replay` package already does this). Rejected: client-side
reconstruction (duplicates the engine in TypeScript) and a snapshot per event
(unbounded memory on perpetual tables).

### D12. Visibility is a per-table policy

`spectator: public | omniscient`. Bot-only tables default to omniscient; any
table with a human seat defaults to public and the host may opt in. Library
order is hidden in both modes (count only): it spoils draws and teaches
nothing. `public` is exactly today's spectator redaction — a viewer with no
seat.

### D13. Client is a Svelte + Vite TypeScript SPA under `web/`

Built assets are `go:embed`ed into `gorged`. Envelope types are generated
from the Go structs; CI fails if the generated file is stale. SVG overlay for
arrows. Node touches the web build only; the Go module does not change.

### D14. Tables are perpetual with derived seeds

When a match ends the table cools down and starts the next one. Match `k` on
a table uses seed `hash(tableSeed, k)`, so a table's entire history is a pure
function of its configuration. Table IDs are stable; match IDs increment.

### D15. A crashed table halts

A panic or a rejected `Apply` inside the match loop marks the match `crashed`,
writes a crash report, and halts the table. No automatic restart: the
totality rule says a reachable panic is a bug, and a self-healing table hides
it. The overview shows the halted table in red.

### D16. Pacing is the host's clock and nothing else's

The only `time` call in the whole system is the host's inter-decision sleep,
injected as a function so tests run at zero pace. No timestamp enters an
event, an option order, a view or a file the hash chain covers.

## Architecture

### Packages

| Package | Responsibility | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `view` (extended) | Omniscient mode; printing identity and identity token on cards; typed stack objects with labelled targets and bound parameters; deterministic one-line event descriptions | `state`, `events`, `decision`, `cards` |
| `protocol` | Versioned envelope, frame types, JSON encoding, golden fixtures | `view`, `events`, `decision` — types only, never `rules` |
| `host` | Table registry, match loop, pacing, sessions, subscriptions, snapshots, view-at-seq, persistence, crash handling, authorizer hook | `rules`, `seat`, `view`, `replay`, `events`, `protocol` |
| `cmd/gentypes` | Generates `web/src/protocol.ts` from the `protocol` structs by reflection | `protocol` |
| `cmd/gorged` | `net/http` server: SSE stream, POST endpoints, JSON GETs, embedded `web/dist`, flags | `host`, `protocol` |
| `web/` | Svelte SPA: overview, focused table, DVR, images | nothing in Go |

`effects` still never imports `rules`; `host` is the first package allowed to
import `time`.

### `host` surface (illustrative, the plan fixes names)

```go
type Visibility int // Public, Omniscient

type TableConfig struct {
    Name      string
    Seats     int
    Decks     []string       // deck file paths; rotated per match when more than Seats
    Seed      uint64
    Pace      time.Duration  // sleep after each decision; 0 = as fast as possible
    Spectator Visibility
    Perpetual bool
}

type Options struct {
    Dir       string                       // persistence root
    Sleep     func(time.Duration)          // injected; tests pass a no-op
    Authorize func(*http.Request) (Principal, error)
    Ring      int                          // frames kept per session for Last-Event-ID resume
}

type Registry struct{ /* ... */ }

func New(o Options) *Registry
func (r *Registry) AddTable(c TableConfig) (TableID, error)
func (r *Registry) Tables() []TableInfo
func (r *Registry) OpenSession(p Principal) *Session          // one per SSE connection
func (r *Registry) Subscribe(s *Session, sub Subscription) error
func (r *Registry) Unsubscribe(s *Session, t TableID) error
func (r *Registry) ViewAt(t TableID, m MatchID, seq int) (view.View, error)
func (r *Registry) Events(t TableID, m MatchID, since int) ([]events.Event, error)
func (r *Registry) Close() error                              // aborts in-progress matches
```

A `Session` owns one bounded outbound channel of `protocol.Frame` and a ring
of the last `Ring` frames it sent. Subscriptions are `{Table, Mode}` with
`Mode ∈ {overview, focus}`.

### Match loop

One goroutine per table, forever:

```
match := start(table, k)                   // seed = hash(table.Seed, k); write sidecar
for !engine.Over() {
    d := engine.Pending()
    intent := seats[d.Player].Decide(view.Project(..., d))   // bots only in M2a
    if err := engine.Submit(intent); err != nil { crash(err) }   // rejected intent = fatal
    append(match.file, newEvents)          // one JSON line per event, fsync per decision
    if turnStarted { snapshots.keep(seq, engine.Game().Clone()) }
    fanout(newEvents)                      // never blocks: full channel => drop that session
    sleep(table.Pace)
}
finish(match)                              // sidecar: result, chain head, ended
sleep(cooldown); k++                       // Perpetual; else the table goes idle
```

`crash` recovers a panic too: sidecar `crashed`, `<Dir>/crash/<table>-<k>.txt`
with chain head, seq, panic value and stack; table state `halted`; loop exits.

### Persistence

```
<Dir>/
  tables.json                       # registry: table configs and current match index
  <table>/
    <k>.events                      # append-only, one events.Event JSON per line
    <k>.json                        # sidecar: decks, seats, seed, started, ended,
                                    #   result, chain head, state ∈ {live, finished, aborted, crashed}
  crash/<table>-<k>.txt
```

On start the registry reads `tables.json`, marks any `live` sidecar `aborted`,
and starts match `k+1` on each perpetual table. Finished matches are served
read-only through the same `ViewAt` / `Events` calls, reconstructed by
`replay.ReplayTo`.

## Protocol

### Envelope

```json
{ "v": 1, "t": "event", "id": 4182, "table": "t1", "match": 7, "seq": 9130, "body": { } }
```

- `v` — protocol version; bumps only on a breaking change.
- `t` — frame type.
- `id` — session-wide monotonic frame counter; this is the SSE `id:` line, so
  `Last-Event-ID` addresses the session ring, not a match.
- `table`, `match`, `seq` — where the body sits in a match's chain; `seq` is
  the engine's event sequence (the same number the hash chain covers).
- `body` — per-type payload, generated types below.

### Frames, server → client

| `t` | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | first frame of a stream | `{session, tables: [TableInfo]}` |
| `widget` | every decision on a table subscribed in `overview`, coalesced to at most one per pace tick (one per 250 ms when pace is 0) | `{turn, step, active, priority, life: [], poison: [], stack_depth, last: "one-line description", state}` |
| `match_start` | a subscribed table begins match `k` | `{seats: [{name, deck, colour}], seed, spectator}` |
| `snapshot` | on `focus` subscribe, on resume when the ring cannot backfill, on `match_start` for focused tables | `{view: view.View, turn_starts: [seq]}` |
| `event` | each engine event on a focused table | `{event: redacted events.Event, line: "description"}` |
| `decision` | a seat is asked something on a focused table | `{player, kind, prompt}` — no options in M2a |
| `match_end` | a subscribed match ends | `{result, head}` |
| `table_halted` | D15 | `{reason}` |
| `overflow` | the session's channel filled; stream closes after this frame | `{dropped}` |
| `error` | a POST was accepted but failed later | `{code, message}` |

### Requests, client → server

| Method | Path | Body / query | Reply |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/stream` | `Last-Event-ID` header honoured | SSE; `hello` first |
| GET | `/api/tables` | — | `[TableInfo]` |
| GET | `/api/tables/{t}/matches` | — | `[MatchInfo]` (sidecars) |
| GET | `/api/tables/{t}/matches/{k}/view?seq=N` | — | `view.View` at N in the table's visibility |
| GET | `/api/tables/{t}/matches/{k}/events?since=N` | — | `[{seq, event, line}]` |
| POST | `/api/subscribe` | `{session, table, mode}`; `table: "*"` with `mode: overview` subscribes to every table | 204 |
| POST | `/api/unsubscribe` | `{session, table}` | 204 |

Errors: unknown table or match 404; `seq` beyond the chain 409 with the
current head in the body; malformed JSON 400. Every reply is JSON.

### Generated types

`cmd/gentypes` walks the `protocol` package by reflection and writes
`web/src/protocol.ts` (interfaces for every frame body, `view.View` and its
parts, `events.Event`, `decision.Decision`). `make gentypes` regenerates;
`make lint` runs it and fails on a diff.

## Data flow

### Subscribe, snapshot, stream

1. The client opens `/api/stream`; the first frame is `hello` with the
   session id and the table list.
2. It POSTs `subscribe {table: "*", mode: overview}` once, and
   `subscribe {table, mode: focus}` for the one it is looking at.
3. An overview subscription yields `widget` frames. A focus subscription
   yields one `snapshot` (view at the current head in the table's visibility,
   plus the turn-start seqs so far) and then `event` and `decision` frames in
   chain order.
4. On disconnect, `EventSource` reconnects with `Last-Event-ID`. The host
   replays the session ring from that id. If the id is older than the ring or
   the session expired, the stream starts with a fresh `hello`; the client
   re-subscribes and receives fresh snapshots.

### DVR cursor

- The client keeps every `event` it has received for the focused match plus
  the `turn_starts` list. The rendered position is a cursor; live mode pins
  the cursor to the head.
- **Pause** stops the cursor; frames keep arriving and the badge shows how
  many events behind live the cursor is.
- **Step** moves the cursor by one event and fetches `view?seq=N` (cached per
  seq). The transcript highlights the event at the cursor; the board renders
  the fetched view.
- **Scrub** ticks are `turn_starts`; dragging fetches the view at the chosen
  turn start.
- **Return to live** jumps the cursor to the head and resumes rendering from
  the stream.
- Viewing a finished match is the same machinery with no live stream.

### Visibility

`view.Project` gains a mode. `Omniscient` renders every hand and every
face-down object; `Public` is today's redaction for a viewer with no seat;
the per-seat mode is unchanged. `RedactEvents` gets the same mode. Library
order is hidden in every mode.

## View additions

- `CardView.Printing {Name, Set, Number}` — `Set` and `Number` empty until a
  printing table exists (roadmap open question 1); `Token` — a short per-object
  identity token (for example `#12`) so two Goblin Guides are distinguishable
  in the stack, the log and an arrow.
- `StackView.Kind` widens to `spell | ability | trigger`; `Targets` carry a
  label (what the target is, from the ability's `ValidTgts$`); `Params` carry
  bound values (X, chosen modes) when the object has them.
- `view.Describe(g, ev) string` — one deterministic line per event, the same
  string on every replay, used by `widget.last`, `event.line` and the
  transcript. The client never composes rules text.

## Client (`web/`)

- **Routes**: `/` overview, `/t/{table}` focused table, `/t/{table}/m/{k}`
  finished match.
- **Overview** (survey 29–33): a grid of state widgets, never shrunken boards
  — each cell shows a 2×2 life grid in seat colours, a centre turn marker,
  the table name and a stack-depth badge; a shared right rail carries the
  merged, table-tagged feed of `widget.last` lines. Clicking a cell focuses
  it and the seat colours carry across.
- **Focused table** (survey 23–28): board about 70 % of the frame, four
  quadrants in seat colours; a rail about 18 % showing every revealed hand as
  a text list with mana symbols, then the stack as type-banded tiles with
  labelled targets, then the pending-trigger tray (no platform surveyed shows
  pending triggers before the stack; this is ours); identity bars about 11 %
  anchored to each seat's outer corner with life centred; a "recently
  mattered" strip showing the last resolved object large; a rules transcript
  along the bottom.
- **DVR bar**: timeline scrubber with turn ticks, step back / forward,
  live / paused indicator with the behind-live count, return-to-live.
- **Arrows**: an SVG overlay drawing target and attack relationships,
  coloured by relationship.
- **Images**: resolved by exact card name through Scryfall's named-card
  endpoint, memoised in memory and `localStorage`; a text card is the
  fallback and the only rendering when offline. Requests are spaced to stay
  under Scryfall's published rate limit.
- **State**: one store per concern — session/stream, tables, focused match
  (events + cursor), image cache. The DVR cursor is a pure reducer.

## Error handling

| Failure | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Slow or stuck client | Its session channel (bounded, default 256) fills; the host sends `overflow` and closes the stream; the engine loop never waited. The client reconnects and is backfilled or re-snapshotted |
| Engine panic or rejected intent in a match loop | D15: sidecar `crashed`, crash file, table halted, `table_halted` frame |
| Host restart | In-progress matches `aborted`; perpetual tables start their next match; finished matches remain browsable |
| Bad request | 400 / 404 / 409 as above; the stream is unaffected |
| Scryfall unavailable | Text cards; no error surfaced beyond a muted badge |

## Testing

- **View**: leak walk in `Public` mode over random 4-seat games — no hand or
  library identity of any seat in any view or redacted event; the same walk
  in `Omniscient` — every hand visible, library still count-only.
  `Describe` is deterministic across replays.
- **View-at-seq property**: for random N, the view from nearest snapshot plus
  replay equals the view from a full replay to N (compared by hash).
- **Protocol**: golden fixtures under `protocol/testdata/`; encode/decode
  round-trip; `make gentypes` output diff-checked in `make lint`.
- **Host** (injected no-op sleep): the same configuration run twice yields
  byte-identical `.events` files and sidecar heads; a subscriber that never
  reads is dropped with `overflow` inside a bounded time while the match
  advances; an injected panic produces `crashed`, a crash file, `halted`,
  and no restart; a restart marks `live` matches `aborted` and starts `k+1`
  with the derived seed.
- **HTTP** (`httptest`): `hello` first; `focus` yields `snapshot` then
  monotonic `seq`; `Last-Event-ID` resume returns exactly the missed frames;
  an id older than the ring yields a fresh `hello`; 404 / 409 paths.
- **Client**: Vitest for the cursor reducer (pause, step, scrub, return to
  live, behind-live count) and envelope parsing; Playwright against a real
  `gorged` with two bot tables at a small pace — overview shows two widgets,
  focus shows a board, pause plus step back moves the seq badge, return to
  live resumes. `make test-e2e-web`.
- **Soak**: `gorged` with 4 perpetual tables at zero pace for 10 minutes;
  RSS bounded, no goroutine growth, every match replays.
- **Lint**: `make lint` gains `svelte-check` and eslint; blocking.
- **Totality**: unchanged — one goroutine per match; any stall or panic in a
  test is a failure.

## Done when

`gorged -decks internal/testutil/decks -tables 4 -seats 4 -pace 1.5s` runs
four perpetual bot tables. In a browser: the overview shows four live
widgets; focusing one shows the omniscient board, hands, stack, pending tray,
transcript and card images; pause, step back through a combat, scrub to the
previous turn, return to live; reload mid-match and be backfilled; restart
`gorged` and replay a finished match from the list. All tests above green;
chain heads and `make sim` unchanged; `git ls-files | grep -c '\.txt$'` is 0.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Snapshot memory on long matches | Turn-start snapshots only, dropped when the match finishes (finished matches replay from file) |
| Session rings on many clients | Bounded ring per session; sessions expire after a disconnect timeout |
| The client learns rules to render well | `Describe`, labels and params come from the server; the client is a renderer, and a test greps `web/src` for legality words |
| Scryfall rate limits or downtime | Cache, spacing, text fallback |
| `time` creeps past the host | A new constraint test walks every package's imports and fails on `time` anywhere but `host` and `cmd/gorged` |

## Out of scope, booked

- Player seat: options in `decision` frames, `POST /api/intent {seq, choices}`,
  auto-pass and stops, mulligans, "why not" for illegal actions — M2b.
- Pace control per table, human-visible clocks — later message types.
- Resume of a live match across restart — M5.
