# Engine contracts (not approximations)

These are deliberate, decided behaviours of the gorge engine. None of them is
a defect and none of them is owed to a milestone. They lived in AGENTS.md's
"Known approximations" table, which is a CLOSING REGISTER of real debt; a
contract sitting in that table made the table look longer than the debt is
and invited a ticket that would have been wrong to write.

If one of these ever stops being true, change it here, in the same commit as
the code.

## R-9: the no-ask host degradation contract

A host that cannot answer a decision — the fuzzer, a test harness, a seat
that has left — must never wedge the engine. Every asking primitive
therefore carries a deterministic fallback that completes the resolution.
The fallback is the CONTRACT, not a stand-in for a missing ask: the ask
itself is real for a host that can answer. The named fallbacks are:

- `Charm` takes its first mode and records a Note
  (`effects/misc.go`, `effCharm`'s fallback).
- An exact-`Origin$ Library` `ChangeZone` takes the deterministic
  first-`Min` pick (a quantity-only search) or fails to find (a
  stated-quality search) — `effects/zone.go`
  (`effSearchLibrary`, `applyLibrarySearch`).
- `Scry`/`Surveil` keep every card on top in its existing order (Scry's
  pile B empty, Surveil's graveyard pile empty), recorded as one
  `events.LibraryOrder` — `effects/cardflow.go` (`effLookAndArrange`).
- `RearrangeTopOfLibrary` keeps the existing order (pile A = the offered
  options in offered order) — `effects/cardflow.go`
  (`effRearrangeTopOfLibrary`), `rules/arrange.go` (`handleArrange`).
- `api:TimeTravel` declines every add/remove election —
  `effects/time_travel.go` (`effTimeTravel`).
- Fixed `Choices$` and `VoteCard$` ballots take the first option —
  `effects/vote.go`.
- Any decision kind with no bot-policy arm of its own takes option 0
  through `botpolicy`'s clamp fallback (`botpolicy/policy.go`, `Decide`).
  Where that produces a BAD but legal play rather than merely a neutral one,
  it is real debt and carries a ticket; the clamp itself is the contract.

## api:TimeTravel is implemented, not approximated

Every repetition re-enumerates the affected objects (owned suspended exile
cards, then the controller's battlefield permanents with a TIME counter) in
zone order and poses one `KChoose` add/remove/skip election per object,
`Amount$` repetitions deep. Each ask rides an immutable snapshot
(`Decision.ResumeObjects`) with its cursor and repetition in `ResumeTarget`
and `ResumeRound`, so an answer that drops a counter cannot shift the next
object's cursor. `effects/time_travel.go`, `rules/resolution.go` (the
`time_travel` resume arm). The only stand-in is R-9 above.

## ActivationLimit$ is enforced for every shape the corpus carries

`resolveActivationLimit` (`rules/legal.go`) reports `ok=false` for a value
that is neither a literal, an SVar reference nor an inline `Count$`, and
`activationLimitReached` then does not enforce. The compiled corpus carries
no such shape, so this is unreachable. It becomes debt only if a future
corpus pin introduces one — the census would surface it.

## A Class level's granted body depends on its own primitive

`cards/kw_class.go` (`addLevelGate`) and `rules/class_level.go`
(`classBandGateHolds`) implement the level machinery. A level whose
`AddStaticAbility$`/`AddTrigger$`/`AddReplacementEffect$` names an
unimplemented mode or effect is exactly as dead as that primitive, and the
debt belongs to that primitive's own ticket, not to Class.

One decision to honour: a `ClassBand$` band must NOT be folded into
`IsPresent$`/`IsPresent2$`. The trigger gate reads those as a UNION and a
granted replacement reads no `IsPresent2$` at all, so folding silently
widens the gate.

## Regeneration

A permanent with an unused this-turn Shield replaces lethal damage and
`Destroy`/`DestroyAll` through the destruction-replacement path: consume the
shield, clear damage, tap, remove from combat. Shields expire at cleanup.
`NoRegen$` and the Effect-registered `Mode$ CantRegenerate` restriction are
honoured. `effects/regeneration.go`, `effects/zone.go`, `rules/sba.go`,
`rules/combat.go`.

## TargetingPlayer$ Opponent in a multi-opponent game

A target ask whose `TargetingPlayer$` names `Opponent` (or
`Player.Opponent`) is answered by the first living opponent in `AliveFrom(0)`
turn order — the same deterministic rule the trigger-time resolver
(`rules/trigger_queue.go`'s `targetChooserFromSpec`) has always used. This
covers every ask site: the CR 601.2c cast/activation ask (`rules/cast.go`),
the trigger placement and resolution-sub asks (`rules/stack.go`), and the
mid-resolution `ValidTgts$` asks posed below the rules tier
(`effects.chosenTargetsFor`'s "tgts" ask and `effects.changeZoneChosenTargets`'s
"choice" ask, which reach the same resolver through `effects.Host.ChooserFor`).
Forge's
parameter does not say which of several opponents picks, so the engine does
not pose a chooser-selection decision; it names the first living opponent and
fails over to the next when that seat has left the game. Target legality and
the decision's `TargetEffect` stay relative to the ability's controller; only
the answering seat moves. Trigger-relative `TargetingPlayer$` referents keep
failing closed to the controller when their binding is absent.

## The board clock's round number is exact

`view.RoundOf` folds the ordered event stream, anchored on the starting
player and tracking eliminations, so an elimination alone never moves the
round. Every log-bearing caller (host fan-out, `viewAt`, the seat view,
mtgsim, botbench, keywordbench) uses it; `roundOf` is only the snapshot
fallback. It never touches engine state. Revisit if a same-seat repeat turn
(`AddTurn`) ever lands.
