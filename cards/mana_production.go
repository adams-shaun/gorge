// ManaProduction is a face's mana-production capability summary, expressed
// as plain data so any later package (view, botpolicy, the seat adapter) can
// carry it without importing a package to its right. It is derived from the
// face's own abilities -- never from land subtypes. A face with several mana
// abilities lists their possible production here; rules selects exactly one
// when a shared tap cost is paid (rules/mana_activation.go).
//
// Colour is indexed the same way state.Mana is (W, U, B, R, G, then
// colourless), so a caller that also imports state can translate an index
// with state.ManaIndex. A dual land may list both possible colours here, but
// selecting one of its distinct mana abilities on activation adds only that
// selected ability's mana.
//
// Any reports that at least one mana ability's Produced$ was not a plain
// colour string: "Any"/"Combo Any", a listed "Combo X Y" choice, or a
// "Chosen"/"Special" word (any token the symbol grammar cannot read). Such a
// source is conditional in the card script, so a policy must not treat it as
// a dependable colour fixer. Colour carries what a plain token names (one each
// for "R G", two for "RR") and the real alternatives of a choice token. It
// never counts letters of script words as phantom mana: Chosen is represented
// by all five possible colours because its source-specific choice is not
// available to this source-free parser.

//     as (0, false): NOT a guaranteed amount. The collector must not
//     record a source as producing mana the pool will never be promised.

// through it, so the two cannot drift the way the pre-fb-windgrace rune walk
// let them (walking "Combo B R" one rune at a time counted the letters of
// the word "Combo" as five phantom colourless).
//
// The grammar, deliberately narrow and fail-closed (the effMana convention):
//
//   - blank is one colourless; exactly "Any" or exactly "Combo Any" is one
//     possible unit in each of the five colours plus any (the executor asks
//     for that colour when a decision-capable host is present);
//   - braces are stripped, the value is split on whitespace, and a leading
//     literal "Combo" token is dropped (it names a choice, not a symbol);
//     a Combo-prefixed value is a script-level CHOICE among its tokens, so
//     it is flagged any however well-formed its tokens are;
//   - every remaining token either consists solely of the symbols WUBRGC
//     -- each of its runes then adds one unit of its slot, so "RR" is two
//     red and "R G" is one red and one green -- or it names a script-level
//     choice ("Chosen", "ColorIdentity", a "Special ..." word). Chosen
//     exposes all five possible colours; the other unmodelled words claim no
//     mana while setting any. A token is rejected whole: a word
//     that merely CONTAINS a symbol letter ("ColorIdentity" contains "C")
//     is not a symbol and must not be walked, or the phantom is back.
//
// The caller multiplies the counts by the ability's Amount$ (or applies its
