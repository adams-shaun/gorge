// kwBackup expands CR 702.70 Backup: "When this creature enters, put N +1/+1
// counters on target creature. If that's another creature, it gains the
// following abilities until end of turn." (The abilities themselves are the
// keyword's second colon field, a named SVar -- Forge spells the whole rider
// as e.g. `K:Backup:1:BackupAbilities` with
// `SVar:BackupAbilities:DB$ Animate | Keywords$ Flying | ...`.)
//
// The expansion is one ChangesZone self-entry trigger whose body is a
// TARGETED PutCounter (the Mentor shape, cards/kw_mentor.go) chained to a
// grant SubAbility built from the named SVar's own body. The named body is
// already the correct primitive -- `DB$ Animate` or `DB$ Pump` on every
// corpus carrier -- so streaming it verbatim keeps whatever riders the
// carrier prints (Keywords$, Triggers$, staticAbilities$, Abilities$, sVars$)
// flowing through their ordinary parsing, never re-implemented here.
//
// Two injections make that verbatim body behave as the keyword's rider:
//
//   - `Defined$ Targeted` anchors it on the PutCounter's own target. The
//     corpus bodies name no Defined$ at all, and an untargeted sub-ability
//     defaults to the resolving SOURCE (effects/context.go's Defined), which
//     would grant the abilities to the entering creature -- always, even when
//     the counter went elsewhere.
//
//   - `ConditionDefined$ Targeted | ConditionPresent$ Creature.Other` is CR
//     702.70's "if that's ANOTHER creature": a grant on the source itself
//     would double every ability the source already prints (its printed
//     attack trigger plus the identical granted one fire twice), so the
//     grant sub is gated on the target not being the source. The condition
//     gate is the supported Targeted group (effects/conditions.go), and
//     `Other` is the source-relative filter predicate.
