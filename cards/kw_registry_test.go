// Keyword expansion used to be one switch in keywords.go, which made every
// ticket touching a keyword edit the same file. It is now a table the
// per-keyword kw_*.go files register into. These tests pin the two properties
// that replace what the compiler used to give for free: no head silently loses
// its expander, and no two files claim the same head.

// expandedHeads is every keyword head the switch expanded before the split. A
// head dropping out of the table is a keyword that silently stops expanding --
// no test would otherwise fail, the carrier just quietly loses its ability.

	// Squad (CR 702.66) was added after the split: the corpus carries only

	// that creates one token copy per squad payment (Count$SquadPaid).
	"Squad",
	// CR 702.70 Training: a genuinely new expansion added after the split
	// (not a head the old switch covered), so it is listed here to keep the
	// table equal to the registered set.
	"Training",
	// Melee (CR 702.121): an Attacks trigger pumped by the distinct
	// opponents captured from the whole declare-attackers batch.
	"Melee",
	// Mentor (CR 702.134): an Attacks self-trigger whose body is a targeted
	// PutCounter on another attacking creature with lesser power, added after
	// the split (cards/kw_mentor.go). The strict power restriction rides the
	// body's Mentor$ marker (rules/mentor.go), not a powerLTX spec.
	"Mentor",
	// Appended after the split (each is a keyword whose expansion the
	// pre-split switch never had): Exploit (CR 702.58, task exploit1).
	"Exploit",
	// Offspring (CR 702.175, task offspring1): the corpus carries only the
	// K:Offspring:<cost> line, so the expansion supplies the ETB trigger
	// that creates one 1/1 token copy when the additional cost was paid
	// (Count$OffspringPaid).
	"Offspring",

	// static/trigger/replacement, added after the split (kw-class).

	// expanded into an ETB trigger (task kw-ravenous).

	// whose Charm elects N +1/+1 counters or N Servo tokens.

	// Graft (CR 702.57): enters-with counters plus an optional move trigger.
	"Graft",
	// Reconfigure (CR 702.150, task kw-reconfigure): the attach/unattach
	// activated-ability pair per printed cost (an alternative second colon
	// field like Razorfield Ripper's PayEnergy<3> gets its own pair), both
	// sorcery-speed; the not-a-creature-while-attached switch is derived
	// state (state.Object.ReconfiguredAttached).
	"Reconfigure",
	// Demonstrate (CR 702.152): a SpellCast trigger on the card's own cast
	// whose DB$ Demonstrate body asks the may-copy election and the
	// opponent choice, the copies ordinary StackCopy mints (kw-demonstrate).
	"Demonstrate",
	// Partner with (CR 702.128): the ETB may-search for the named partner is
	// real rules text, not reminder, and no carrier's script prints it (task
	// kw-partner-with). The deck-construction designation half of the keyword
	// is read by deck.IsPartnerPair and is unchanged.
	"Partner with",
	// Backup (CR 702.70, task kw-backup): a ChangesZone ETB trigger whose
	// body is a targeted PutCounter chained to a grant built from the named
	// SVar, gated on the target being another creature. Added after the
	// split; the pre-split switch never had it.
	"Backup",
	// Fortify (CR 702.67): analogous to Equip but targets lands; it was added
	// after the split by kw-fortify and therefore belongs in this registry.
	"Fortify",
	// Battle cry (CR 702.33): an Attacks trigger whose PumpAll selects other
	// creatures that are attacking when the trigger resolves.
	"Battle cry",
	// The K:Prevent sentence keyword (task prevent-keyword-expansion): a
	// printed English sentence with no colon, so the head IS the sentence and
	// the registration is keyed on the three exact sentences the corpus
	// prints (kw-prevent). Added after the split; the pre-split switch never
	// expanded any of them.
	"Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt to CARDNAME.",
	"Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt to and dealt by CARDNAME.",

	// Sunburst (CR 702.47, task kw:Sunburst): a bare K:Sunburst line expanded
	// into the Moved -> Battlefield Updated Repl that puts Count$Converge
	// counters, kind decided on the printed face's types (+1/+1 for a
	// creature, charge otherwise). Added after the split; the pre-split
	// switch never expanded it (cards/kw_sunburst.go).
