// ResolveSVar compiles the ability an SVar name refers to, recursively
// resolving its own SubAbility$ chain the same way Link does for a face's
// printed abilities. Some Forge parameters point at a sub-ability by SVar
// name rather than through the auto-linked "SubAbility$" (Charm's Choices$,
// Repeat's RepeatSubAbility$), so effects primitives that need to actually
// run one of those need a way to compile it on demand, after Parse/Link, from
// the resolving face's own SVar table. A missing name, or a body that fails
// to parse, yields nil rather than a partial result -- callers already treat
// a nil *SA as "nothing to run", the same degrade-to-nothing convention Num
// and EvalCount use for an expression this build does not model.
