   * graveyard/exile icons both write the shared pileOpener store
   * (lib/pileopener.svelte.ts); this host — mounted once by Table.svelte —
   * reads it and renders the modal, so two affordances can never open two
   * dialogs at once and the modal's portalled markup exists exactly once.
   * The host also hands the modal the table's card-options bundle, so the
   * pile's cards become actionable (tone ring, badge, menu — each item
   * posting the option's own index, R-E4-1); null for a spectator or when
   * nothing is pending, exactly like the board tiles read it.
