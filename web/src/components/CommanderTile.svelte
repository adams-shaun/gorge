  /**
   * One commander, drawn as a card in its seat's CREATURES row (CZ2) — a
   * commander is a creature, so it is drawn at the same --card-w the row
   * scales every other creature to, and reads the ambient `--card-w`
   * cascading from `.row.creatures` in Quadrant.svelte rather than setting a
   * scale of its own. Nothing here decides the number; it only inherits it.
   *
   * Commander identity is the premise of the format and a line of text is not
   * how anyone recognises a commander — you recognise it by its art. So this
   * is a card face, not a row: CardImage draws the Scryfall art when it
   * resolves and the typeset blank when it does not, and the blank is the
   * NORMAL state (cmd/gorged ships no catalog, and an offline box resolves
   * nothing). The name and the state therefore sit OUTSIDE the face, under
   * it, at full ink: they read the same whichever half CardImage drew, and
   * they survive the two states where the face is not full-strength — the
   * command zone's greyed art and the away state's empty box.
   *
   * THE TILE IS THE COMMAND ZONE, NOT A PICTURE OF A CARD. The box is always
   * there, drawn with a little dotted border, marking the place on the board
   * that is the command zone; what is inside it depends on where the
   * commander actually is. Art means "the card is somewhere you can see it",
   * full ink means "it is in play", grey means "it is in the zone", and an
   * empty dotted box means "it is not here".
   *
   * THE TAX SITS ON THE FACE, in the corner a printed mana cost occupies —
   * by explicit request, in place of an earlier design that deliberately
   * kept it OFF the face (a derived value in the printed cost's own spot can
   * read as though it IS the printed cost). That risk is real, so the tile
   * marks it as computed rather than printed: parenthesised, `(+N)` rather
   * than a bare number the way a real pip would be, in the initiative colour
   * (not the blank's own text colour) and inside its own translucent chip
   * rather than CardImage's opaque pip disc. It overlays BOTH halves
   * CardImage can draw — the Scryfall art has no DOM hook of its own to
   * anchor a corner value to, so this tile draws its own corner independent
   * of which half rendered.
   *
   * THREE STATES, and every one of them is inspectable. The state is a
   * property of where the card currently is (lib/commander.ts, presenceOf):
   *
   *   command      it sits in the command zone — greyed art, marked
   *                "command zone", plus the CR 903.8 next-cast tax when there
   *                is one — {2} per prior command-zone cast, the DERIVED
   *                number, never the raw count. The tax chip stays on this
   *                in-zone state (it is where the next cast is priced from),
   *                but it no longer justifies full ink: the art is greyed.
   *   battlefield  it is in play, so the box shows FULL art, and it is
   *                marked "on the battlefield". The PERMANENT is what the
   *                board draws for a commander in play — CommandArea filters
   *                battlefield commanders out (ui10, bug 1), so this state
   *                is no longer reached from the board's command area: a
   *                commander in play belongs in the creature row as the real
   *                permanent, not twice. The component still renders it, so
   *                a caller that deliberately hands it a battlefield status
   *                (the test harness) gets full art rather than a guess.
   *   away         anywhere else — graveyard, exile, hand, the stack, or a
   *                zone this viewer cannot browse. An EMPTY box: no art at
   *                all, because the card is not somewhere you can look. The
   *                box, the name and the state band all stay, and the tile
   *                stays inspectable. A commander in a zone this viewer
   *                cannot browse resolves to "library" and is drawn exactly
   *                the same — not being able to see into a zone is not an
   *                error state.
   *
   * Hover dwell or keyboard focus opens the existing CardDetail inspector, in
   * EVERY state including the empty one: an opponent's commander must be
   * readable at any time, including while it sits in a zone nobody can
   * otherwise browse, and that is the reason this feature is on the board
   * rather than in a rail. The wiring is CardTile's — one HoverCard, an
   * anchor rect captured on open, and superviseRendering keeping the panel's
   * lifetime tied to the object it was opened for.
