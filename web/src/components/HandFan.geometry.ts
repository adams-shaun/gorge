/**
 * Geometry fixture for HandFan — the browser half of the hand-card peek
 * (fb-20260916T024357Z-9005ad6a). It mounts the REAL component (not a CSS
 * replica) into a fixed-size, overflow:hidden board-stage equivalent, so the
 * measured rects are what a real hover/focus produces against the real clip.
 * SSR markup alone cannot prove clipping or :hover geometry.
 *
 * The stage is the only box on the page (see the <style> in the .html):
 * position: relative + overflow: hidden, exactly the clipping contract
 * Table.svelte's .board gives the real fan. HandFan's .handtrack is absolute
 * bottom:0 inside it, so the stage's overflow is the clip that cuts the
 * fan's lowered half — which is the behaviour under test.
 *
 * Card art is settled before mount the way CardDetail.geometry.ts settles it:
 * each card's exact-name key under the versioned IMAGE_KEY namespace is
 * seeded with the empty string, the resolver's stored "known no image", so no
 * same-origin /art request is ever fired and every face renders the blank.
 * The blank does not affect the geometry — the .card box sizes itself from
 * width + aspect-ratio 63/88, and that box is what is measured.
 *
 * Seven cards over a 600px room engages the horizontal overlap (natural width
 * 788 > 600, step ≈ 82.7 < 104): the fan genuinely overlaps, so the hovered
 * card's z-order over its neighbours is observable through elementFromPoint
 * in the band two cards share. The first card is the one driven, because
 * sibling painting order puts its RIGHT neighbour on top of it at rest —
 * only the hover raise's z-index can put it back on top there, which makes
 * the assertion discriminate.
