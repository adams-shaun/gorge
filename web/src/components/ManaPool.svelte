  /**
   * ManaPool draws the seat box's line-3 mana readout, which the product spec
   * (B1) defines as "the mana pool OR free mana one gains by tapping lands or
   * other effects". Those are two different things and the box has one row, so
   * this renders BOTH, deliberately distinct:
   *
   *   - AVAILABLE (the outlined chips) is what player could produce right now
   *     by tapping untapped permanents' free-to-tap mana abilities. It is
   *     derived from the public battlefield, so it is present on EVERY seat
   *     and EVERY visibility — and it is the content of this row in the
   *     ordinary case, because floating mana only ever exists inside a step.
   *   - POOL (the solid saturated chips) is mana already floating. It is
   *     public (CR 106.4a/106.4b: a mana pool is not one of the seven zones in
   *     CR 400.1 and holds no cards, so CR 400.2's hidden-zone framework has no
   *     purchase on it; instead 106.4a, 106.4b, 117.3d and 118.3a all require a
   *     player to ANNOUNCE what is in their pool). view.PlayerView.Pool is
   *     filled for every seat under every visibility, always a non-nil object
   *     ("{}" when empty), never a JSON null.
   *
   * A reader must never mistake the two, so they are separated by a divider
   * and styled opposite ways: available mana is hollow (a potential, not yet
   * spent) and labelled tap, floating mana is saturated (mana here) and
   * labelled pool. The labels are persistent text, not hover-only tooltips — a
   * sighted reader looking at a static board can tell the two groups apart
   * without moving the pointer and without relying on the fill difference
   * (subtle on a near-white chip, invisible to a colour-blind reader). When
   * either group is empty it renders nothing, and when both are empty the row
   * still exists (IdentityBar reserves its height) so the box does not grow a
   * line when mana appears and collapse the moment it is spent.
   *
   * The wire's two maps are exactly the six symbols poolView emits
   * (view/visibility.go), so this reads them in a fixed WUBRGC order rather
   * than iterating the object: a readout that reorders itself between frames
   * cannot be read at a glance, and object key order is not a guarantee worth
   * depending on.
   *
   * pool is now public and so is always a non-nil object from the server, but
   * the generated protocol.ts types both fields as plain Records, so neither
   * svelte-check nor the type checker can catch a caller that hands this a
   * null — the null/absent guard therefore lives here, at the one place that
   * owns "an absent group draws nothing". The pool-null branch is retained
   * defensively but is no longer reachable from the wire: the retired
   * redaction (which sent null for a hidden pool) is gone.
