  /**
   * StackTile is one stack entry: a band coloured by kind, its card face
   * when it has one, its text, and its targets. Resolving a target's object
   * id to a display name is a rendering concern — it reads every visible
   * zone in `view` but decides nothing about the game. emphasized/dimmed
   * express survey item 10 (the top of the stack reads by contrast): the
   * seat view passes emphasized for the top entry and dimmed for the rest;
   * the spectator path renders them unset, unchanged.
   *
   * Density (U-rail-2, "we can hardly see 1 card"): the art is drawn at a
   * fixed, smaller `--card-w` than the board's own tiles — a stack entry is
   * read for identity and targets, not inspected at battlefield size, and
   * the large read is one hover away (below) — and the oracle-ish text line
   * is clamped to two lines rather than running to a paragraph, so several
   * entries fit in the stack's now-larger, but still finite, flex share.
   *
   * ART FALLBACK (Task 2a): `stack.card` is nil for a trigger or activated
   * ability today (an ability object has no card face — view/view.go), a gap
   * another task is closing on the Go side by falling back to the source
   * permanent's own card view. This component's job is only to use it
   * whenever it is there and do nothing when it is not: `{#if stack.card}`
   * already does exactly that, and needs no change here to pick up the Go
   * fix — a stack entry with no card face simply keeps rendering as it does
   * today, text only, no broken image, no placeholder box.
   *
   * HOVER (Task 2b): a stack card could not be inspected the way a
   * battlefield card can — no hover at all was wired. Wired here to the same
   * HoverCard dwell/focus/CardDetail mechanism CardTile and HandList use.
   * `hover.supervise` is the lifecycle half of that contract (carddetail.
   * svelte.ts): it takes the object id the panel is CURRENTLY showing and an
   * INDEPENDENT list of the objects still present, and closes the panel when
   * the id is no longer in that list — e.g. this entry's card leaves the
   * stack (resolves, is countered) while the pointer is still over it, which
   * never fires pointerleave. The list passed here is every card CURRENTLY
   * on the stack across every entry (`view.stack`), read fresh off `view` —
   * not `[stack.card]`, which would make the check ask whether stack.card's
   * id is in a list containing only stack.card's id: always true, the exact
   * tautology CardTile once shipped and that this rail must not repeat.
