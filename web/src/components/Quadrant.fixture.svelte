   * holds one Grizzly Bear (object 7); the window hooks below mutate the LIVE
   * view the way an incoming stream frame would — same-object state updates,
   * a replaced object, a removed object — so the test can prove the keyed
   * battlefield-list update path in Quadrant, not the HoverCard class in
