 *
 *  - 1v1 (seats ≤ 2): the viewer sits at the BOTTOM and their opponent at the
 *    TOP — the universal convention (Arena, MTGO, XMage, Cockatrice, every
 *    paper table). This is relative, not absolute: seat 1 viewing a 1v1 sees
 *    THEMSELVES at the bottom and seat 0 at the top, and vice versa. A
 *    spectator (view.NoSeat 255, or any viewer not present at the table) has
 *    no horse in the race, so the arrangement is deterministic by seat
 *    number: seat 0 at the bottom, seat 1 at the top — the same default a
 *    client that had no idea who you were would pick.
 *
 *  - 3 and 4 seats are re-anchored to the viewer the same way, by ROTATING the
 *    bottom-left-then-clockwise cycle so the viewer lands at `bl`. The index
 *    is `(seat - viewer + seats) % seats` into the same `bl, tl, tr, br`
 *    cycle, so turn order around the table is preserved — a player still
 *    reads "who is to my left" off the felt. A spectator (view.NoSeat 255, or
 *    any viewer not present at the table) has no horse in the race, so the
 *    layout stays deterministic by seat number: seat 0 at `bl`, then
 *    clockwise, exactly as {@link quadrantFor}'s historic layout drew it.
