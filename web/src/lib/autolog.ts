/**
 * autolog is the client-local, non-engine log of automatic passes (prio5).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: it is not the event-sourced log. The transcript's real
 * lines are server-described events (DvrState.events, host/describe.go);
 * those are hash-chained and replayed, and nothing here touches them — no
 * event is emitted, nothing is posted to the server, and a note exists only
 * in the browser tab that made the pass. It exists because Forge's players
 * found invisible instant passing disorienting: with casual pacing the seat
 * passes dozens of windows a turn, and `settings.logAutoPasses` (prio2,
 * editable since prio4) is the player's "show me what was skipped".
 *
 * SHAPE: one note per automatic pass, appended in pass order, each carrying
 * the engine turn it was made in so a reader can place it. The transcript
 * has no grouping primitive — its rows are event-seq-keyed scrub buttons and
 * a local note has no seq — so notes are one line each, and the list is
 * CAPPED: the oldest notes fall off past AUTO_LOG_CAP, so a long auto-passed
 * stretch (up to AUTO_PASS_CAP = 40 windows in one unbroken run) can add at
 * most AUTO_LOG_CAP lines to the log and can never flood it.
