/**
 * actedOption reports whether the posted `choices` (wire indices) contain at

 * passes isActionKind (autopilot.ts): neither pass, nor concede, nor
 * activate. The kind comes off the wire option itself, resolved by index; a
 * choice that names no option on the decision is not an action. This is the
 * arming test for pass-after-acting, and it is the per-choice counterpart of
 * `actionable`'s per-decision test — the SAME shared predicate (isActionKind),
 * so the two cannot drift apart again. The activate exclusion is the fix for
 * fb-3ab6d9da. The wire fact it rests on: in a PRIORITY decision, Kind
 * "activate" is only ever the tap-for-mana option (rules/legal.go's
 * availableManaAbilities loop — `add("activate", "Tap <name> for mana", id)`);
 * non-mana activated abilities are offered as Kind "ability" (legal.go's
 * ability loop), and the one other "activate" on the wire (cast.go's mid-cast
 * mana-source ask) sits on a non-priority decision, which the kind test above
 * already refuses. A mana tap therefore arms nothing: it is not "I am done
 * acting" — it is the prelude to acting in the NEXT window, the one where the
 * freshly floated mana makes the held spell affordable and the engine offers
 * the cast. Counting the tap as an action machine-passed exactly that window,
 * so the player never saw the spell become playable. An earlier version of
 * this comment claimed to mirror `actionable`'s kind test while inlining a
 * test that did not — now both call the one shared predicate.
