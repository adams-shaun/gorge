/**
 * modals.ts is the live-DOM half of the hotkey grammar's modal guard
 * (prio3 review r2): the pure grammar in hotkeys.ts takes a `pickerOpen`
 * callback, and this module is what that callback is in the wiring.
 *
 * MODAL_PICKER_SELECTOR (defined beside the grammar so the two cannot
 * drift) recognizes modal/picker semantics structurally: menu, dialog and
 * listbox roles, aria-modal, and an open native dialog. The pre-existing
 * OptionPicker and PileModal data markers remain included as stable hooks.
 * That structural net means a new correctly marked-up picker is safe without
 * requiring another component-specific selector.
 *
 * The probe reads the live document, so it is DOM work the pure grammar
 * deliberately does not do.
