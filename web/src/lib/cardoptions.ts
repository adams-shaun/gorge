 * cardoptions.ts is the ONE mechanism behind three symptoms (task ui21):

 * get highlighted". They are one fact — *the pending decision offers you
 * something involving this card* — and that fact is already on the wire:
 * every decision's Option carries `obj`, the board object the option
 * concerns, whether it is a cast, an activation, a target, an attacker or a
 * blocker. This module groups a decision's options by that `obj`.
 *
 * R-E4-2 (the client is rules-ignorant): the index grouping is a pure
 * re-grouping of options the server already sent. Nothing here, and nothing
 * the board does with it, decides what an ability is, what a legal target
 * is, or what a blocker is. A target option and a cast option are the same
 * shape on the wire, so ONE index serves both "highlight cards with valid
 * options" and "highlight valid targets". No `kind` is special-cased.
 *
 * R-E4-1 (never resolve an option by position): every function here keys
 * options by their own `index` (carried through from the decision). The tile
 * posts the option's own index — never a position in a list the client
 * rebuilt.
 *
 * Pure functions only: no Svelte, no DOM, no storage. `cardoptions.test.ts`
 * builds decisions by hand and asserts nothing about creatures or combat.
