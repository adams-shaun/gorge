 * bar's new graveyard/exile icons both open the same PileModal, through one
 * store, so a pile cannot open twice at once. The store holds only WHICH
 * pile is open (seat, zone, the trigger element for focus return); the
 * single modal instance that renders it lives in PileHost.svelte, mounted
 * once by Table.svelte, so exactly one dialog can exist in the DOM no
 * matter how many affordances open one. Same shape as layoutsettings's
 * LayoutStore: a class with $state fields, exported as a module singleton.
 *
 * PileZone is ZoneName (graveyard/exile — the two card-list zones
 * zonesFor projects) plus 'hand', the third pile the rail's buttons open;
 * the wire never exposes library cards, so library is not a pile anywhere.
