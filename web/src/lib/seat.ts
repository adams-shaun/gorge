/**
 * seat.ts is the page's seat identity, read ONCE from the join URL that
 * M2e-3's gorged prints on startup (FL-99): `?seat=N&token=…`. The seat is
 * "which player am I acting for" — a number and a bear credential, nothing
 * more. No rules knowledge lives here; the server's decision.Validate is
 * the whole contract.
 *
 * The token is a bearer credential for a local fixture. It is held here and
 * built into request URLs in api.ts, and nowhere else: never logged, never
 * put in the transcript, never rendered, never echoed in an error message.
 * The render path (routes/components) receives only SeatCtx via getSeat,
 * and no component string ever interpolates `token`.
