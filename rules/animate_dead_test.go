// The Animate Dead / Dance of the Dead end-to-end pins (the
// api:Animate.RemoveKeywords ticket). The graveyard-enchant Aura family casts
// at a creature card in a graveyard (K:Enchant:Creature.inZoneGraveyard), its
// ETB trigger reanimates the enchanted card, and the reanimate chain's
// `DB$ Animate | RemoveKeywords$ ... | Keywords$ ...` swaps the stale graveyard
// enchant for the granted "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with
// CARDNAME". Four defects kept that chain from ever running; each test here
// pins one home:
//
//   - the cast offer (rules/stack.go targetZones' Attach-scoped inZone census),
//   - the resolution attach onto the off-battlefield bearer
//     (effects/attach.go effAttach),
//   - the CR 704.5m sweep's off-battlefield-bearer exemption for the window
//     between entry and the reanimate trigger (rules/attach.go
//     attachmentSBAs),
//   - the SBA reading the DERIVED enchant, so the post-animate board survives
//     (rules/attach.go auraStillMatchesEnchant) and the stale enchant is gone
//     from the derived list (effects/combatfx.go effAnimate's RemoveKeywords$
//     read, registered through the layer-6 walk).
