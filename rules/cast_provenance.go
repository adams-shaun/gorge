// The rules-side split for the cast-provenance filter predicates (tasks
// castprov1 and castprov2). The predFn signature the effects filter runs on
// carries no Host, and a hand-origin cast deliberately carries no CastFlags
// bit (the flags mark alternative costs and origins only), so the provenance
// lives in the event log — Engine reads it through reverse PutOnStack scans,
// the same machinery the Count$ branch heads read. The tokens are therefore
// split OUT of the spec text at the rules-side match sites (where the
// Engine, and its log, is in scope) and evaluated there, with the remainder
// matched by the ordinary filter. The precedent is the spec-rewrite helpers
// the engine already keeps (spellCastPermanentSpec, permanentCardSpec).
//
// The two families, and their exact semantics:
//
//   - wasCastFromYourHandByYou (castprov1): the object's LATEST PutOnStack
//     event names the cast, and it was from hand, by you.
//   - wasCastByYou (castprov2, the "When CARDNAME enters, if you cast it"
//     ETB family — Zacama, Marina Vendrell's Grimoire, Nine-Lives
//     Familiar's etbCounter gate): SOME PutOnStack event for this object
//     names you as caster — the oracle's "if you cast it" does not care
//     where from. A copy was never cast (the same IsCopy guard both reads
//     take). Shared approximation of both scans: they read only the event
//     log's casts, so they cannot distinguish a card that was cast and then
//     re-entered play without a cast (reanimated and friends) — the
//     exists-scan still answers "you did cast it, earlier", which is the
//     oracle's own wording.
//
//   - wasCastFromYourHand (castprov3): the object's LATEST PutOnStack event
//     names the cast AND that cast came from a hand — ANY caster. The bare
//     spelling is the one the "from anywhere other than your hand" carriers
//     print (Vega the Watcher, Bilbo Thief in the Night, Mm'menon's
//     RestrictValid$); every carrier that needs player scoping supplies it
//     elsewhere (ValidActivatingPlayer$ You on the trigger lines, YouCtrl or
//     wasCastByYou in the same Affected$/Count spec), measured over the 46
//     raw carrier files. A copy was never cast (the same IsCopy guard both
//     existing families take); a card never put on the stack reads false.
//
//   - the origin-zone family (task wascastfrom): wasCastFromExile,
//     wasCastFromYourGraveyard, wasCastFromYourGraveyardByYou and
//     wasCastFromTheirHand — the object's LATEST PutOnStack cast came from
//     the named zone (and, for the YourGraveyard spellings, was made by the
//     evaluating you). The bare wasCastFromGraveyard spelling is NOT here:
//     it is the effects-side CastFlags predicate (FlagFlashback | Harmonize
//     | Escaped, effects/filter.go), which the rules-side strip must leave
//     in place for the effects-only call sites (the ConditionPresent gates,
//     the target ValidTgts$ matching) — and the log read and the flag read
//     agree on every shape the flag covers, so a rules-side site that strips
//     the other four never disagrees with an effects-side site that keeps it.
//     The flag set itself is state.WasCastFromGraveyard (flashback, harmonize,
//     jump-start, escaped), shared with the three effects call sites so the
//     two reads cannot drift.
//     The same latest-cast-wins and copy-was-never-cast guards the hand
//     families take apply here.
//
// castProvenanceAdmits is the combined entry point every match site calls:
// it evaluates all the families in one pass, so a future carrier mixing the
// tokens in one spec is covered by construction (measured: alex_wilder
// and quandrix_the_proof carry wasCastByYou AND the bare token in one
// alternative).
