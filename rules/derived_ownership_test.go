// on: Engine.Clone must NOT copy those scratch buffers (rules/clone.go), so
// a clone grows its own, and a Derived call on one engine can never overwrite
// or alias the buffer the other engine is reading. If Clone were to share the
// buffer fields, the two engines below would write into the same backing
// array and corrupt each other's Derived result. This runs both engines'
// Derived in parallel goroutines so a shared buffer races, not just aliases.
