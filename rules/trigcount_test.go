// Task trigcount1: the TriggerCount$ heads (SVar bodies like
// TriggerCount$DamageAmount) were unimplemented, so "whenever CARDNAME deals
// damage, you gain that much life" resolved as zero. These tests pin the
// end-to-end fix through the real trigger machinery: a Damage event fires a
// DamageDone trigger, whose ability resolves with Ctx.TriggerAmount carrying
// the amount the triggering event dealt, so the gain (or any other "that
// much" sized effect) is N rather than 0.

// TestTriggerCountDamageAmountGainsThatMuchLife is the brief's primary leaf.
// The card is the exact shape the brief names -- a creature with "whenever
// this deals damage to a player, you gain that much life". It is synthetic
// because every real corpus card with this wording is not currently able to
// fire through the engine: it either uses the unregistered DamageDoneOnce
// mode (Metropolis Reformer, Kami of the Honored Dead) or a ValidSource$
// the engine's damageSource() cannot satisfy for non-ability damage
// (Kjeldoran Gargoyle) -- see the report's Issues section. The SVar body
// (TriggerCount$DamageAmount) and the GainLife effect are the real ones; the
// fix under test is that the head resolves to the event's amount instead of
// 0.
