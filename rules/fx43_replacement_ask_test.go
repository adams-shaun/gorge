// Task fx43: does a mid-resolution ask inside a REPLACEMENT resume at all?
//
// Mox Diamond is the sharpest of the four corpus cards whose ReplaceWith$
// body is itself a discard asker (the others are Chains of Mephistopheles,
// Magus of the Chains and Indominus Rex Alpha). Its R: line intercepts its
// own stack->battlefield Move and replaces it with "you may discard a land
// card; if you do, put Mox Diamond onto the battlefield, otherwise it goes
// to your graveyard". The ReplaceWith body (SVar:PayBeforeETB) is a
// Mode$ TgtChoose discard -- a mid-resolution KModes ask -- and that choice
// is exactly what decides whether Mox lands on the battlefield or in the
// graveyard.
//
// This drives a REAL compiled corpus card end to end through the cast and
// resolve path with no synthetic SA. The correct outcome is: the discard ask
// surfaces while Mox is still on the stack; answering it discards ONE land
// and completes the replacement's own body so Mox enters the battlefield.
//
// Current behaviour is BROKEN (the reason this test exists and the diagnosis
// this task was asked to establish):
//
//  1. The ask IS posed (a suspended-resolution KModes "discard" decision
//     surfaces) -- but by the time it is pending, Mox has ALREADY been moved
//     off the stack. The ensureLeftTheStack guard (rules/stack.go) treats a
//     SUSPENDED replacement -- its event already marked handled, its body
//     still awaiting the discard answer -- as a replacement that "fully
//     replaced the move without relocating the object", so it parks Mox in
//     its resting zone (the graveyard) before the answer can resume the body.
//  2. The pending answer then no-ops: resumeResolution (rules/resolution.go)
//     finds the object already off the stack and running the suspended
//     sub-ability would have nothing left to act on, so the replacement's
//     remaining body (discard the land, then MoveToBattlefield) never runs and
//     no land is ever discarded.
//  3. Separately, even if the parking were held off, applyingReplacement does
//     not survive the suspension: applyReplacements resets it to false when
//     the suspended body returns, so when the resumed body emits its own
//     stack->battlefield completion move it is re-intercepted by the SAME
//     replacement and re-poses the discard (measured: on Mox the replacement
//     body re-enters and the discard is posed repeatedly).
//
// The regression pin below is on the UNFIXED behaviour: it
// asserts the correct outcome (Mox on the battlefield, one land discarded,
// Mox still on the stack while its discard is pending). Any one of these
// assertions failing is the task's answer -- the fix has to make
// ensureLeftTheStack defer the park while suspended and thread the
// replacement context across the resume (rules/resolution.go).
//
// fx44 (the fix it pins) now makes all of this pass: ensureLeftTheStack
// defers the park while a replacement is suspended (the object stays on the
// stack for its answer), and the resume threads the replacement context --
// applyingReplacement (so the completed move is not re-intercepted by the
// same replacement) plus Replaced/Remembered (so the body's Defined$
// ReplacedCard and SVar:X Remembered$Amount gating find their subject) --
// back across the suspension. The guard below is therefore removed and the
// test joins the ordinary suite.
