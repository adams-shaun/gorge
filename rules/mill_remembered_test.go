// The Mill-remember fix (task agent-20260918T201731Z-86b4ef09): effMill never
// recorded which cards it milled, so a chained "put a card from among them
// into your hand" pickup -- filtered on Card.IsRemembered -- found nothing and
// silently no-oped after the mill. Six is the shape end to end: it mills
// three on attack (RememberMilled$ True), picks a milled land into hand
// (ChangeType$ Land.IsRemembered), then DB$ Cleanup | ClearRemembered$ True.
//
// Six is the corpus's only repo-deck RememberMilled$ carrier (pro-shaper.json)
// and, crucially, uses a TYPED base (Land.IsRemembered) -- the bare
// Permanent.IsRemembered family hits a separate zone-blind matchesBase defect
// (see the report's Issues section) that would mask this fix.
//
// No Forge script text is committed: Six is fetched from the corpus registry.
