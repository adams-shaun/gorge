// Task greatestpower1: the extreme-reduction property suffixes
// ($GreatestCardPower and siblings) were not recognised by the zone-count
// dispatch, so a card whose amount is "the greatest power among creatures you
// control" sized itself to zero. This leaf drives the REAL Orcish Siegemaster
// script (pasted inline -- Forge scripts are GPL and never committed) through
// the attack-trigger machinery and asserts the pump's NumAtt is the greatest
// power among the controller's creatures, with two different board strengths
// so a hard-coded value cannot pass.
