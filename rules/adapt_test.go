// Task param-adapt (CR 702.35a): Adapt$ N on AB$ PutCounter was unread --
// the activation was offered without the CR 702.35a gate ("Activate only if
// this creature has no +1/+1 counters on it") and, worse, resolved placing
// the CounterNum$-default ONE counter instead of N. effPutCounter now reads
// Adapt$ N as the count (rules/effects/counters.go), the put is itself
// conditional on the recipient holding no +1/+1 counters (the effect half of
// 702.35a, which also governs Jetfire's chained `DB$ PutCounter | Adapt$ 3`
// body, where no activation gate exists), and the offer loops in
// rules/legal.go gate the activation through e.adaptGateOK -- the same
// offer-time funnel the IsPresent$/CheckSVar$/Boast$ gates share.
//
// Pteramander is the measured census carrier (`grep -rlE '^A:AB$
// PutCounter.*Adapt\$' .cards/cardsfolder` = 24 files): its ability is
//
//	A:AB$ PutCounter | Cost$ 7 U | Adapt$ 4 | ReduceCost$ X
//	SVar:X:Count$ValidGraveyard Instant.YouOwn,Sorcery.YouOwn
//
// so the leaves also exercise the accompanying ReduceCost$ discount through
// the existing ownReduceCost fold (the offer is only affordable at all when
// the graveyard discount is read -- the fixture funds less than the full
// price on purpose).
//
// Fixtures load the REAL compiled corpus card (never a copied Forge script).
