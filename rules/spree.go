// Spree (CR 702.171) and Tiered are casting-option keywords: like Kicker or
// Surge they are read directly by rules rather than expanded into a trigger,
// replacement or activated ability, so there is no cards/keywords.go case.
// What they carry is a modal spell ("SP$ Charm") whose per-mode SVar bears a
// ModeCost$ -- the additional cost a chosen mode charges on top of the
// printed mana cost. Registering the heads keeps make report honest about the
// keyword being implemented (the casting-option set kw:Kicker/kw:Surge
// already lives in this package).

// modeCost resolves one Charm mode's per-mode additional cost from the SVar
// the mode names (Forge's ModeCost$ on the DB/SP line, e.g. Requisition
// Raid's three `DB$ ... | ModeCost$ 1` modes). The three results are distinct
// on purpose:
//
//   - present=false: the mode carries no ModeCost$ at all -- a free mode.
//   - present=true, ok=true: a ModeCost$ this build can price.
//   - present=true, ok=false: a ModeCost$ is PRINTED but ParseCost cannot
//     model a token in it. This must never read as "free" (a mandatory
//     additional cost silently dropping to zero is a widening), so every
//     caller withholds the mode and the cast cannot select it. Distinguishing
//     the unparseable shape from the absent one is the whole point of the
//     third result -- the pre-review signature collapsed both into ok=false.
