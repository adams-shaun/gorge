// Regressions for the review round on the UntilYourNextTurn animate lifetime:
// the prior round only pinned extra turns already QUEUED at registration
// (AddContinuous's nextTurnFor walk). These two pin the other half -- a +1
// ExtraTurn grant emitted AFTER Karn's +1 resolved, which the frozen
// registration-time UntilTurn cannot see. EndOfTurnCleanup reschedules the
// boundary from the live rotation and queue before the expiry walk, so the
// animation must track the controller's next ACTUAL turn in both directions:
// the controller's own late grant moves the boundary EARLIER (the extra turn
// is the next turn -- the animation ends as it begins), another seat's late
// grant moves it LATER (the animation outlives the inserted turns).

// TestKarnAnimateDropsBeforeLateKarnExtraTurn: animate on turn 1 with no
// pending grants, then grant Karn's controller an extra turn. The granted
// turn is turn 2 and IS Karn's next turn, so the animation ends at turn 1's
// cleanup and must not be active during it.
