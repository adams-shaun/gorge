// ActivationPhases$ is Forge's cast/activation WINDOW restriction: the
// phase or range a spell's SP$ or an ability's AB$ may be offered in
// ("Cast CARDNAME only before the combat damage step", "Activate only
// during your upkeep"). The ONE phase-name parser (state.ParsePhases) is
// already built for it -- state/phase.go's doc names ActivationPhases$ as a
// consumer -- but until now nothing read the parameter, so every such card
// was offered in every step.
//
// The gate is a PURE READ, like activationLimitReached: the offer walks are
// pure reads and must never emit an event. An absent parameter is ungated
// (the same "absent Phase$ remains ungated" rule phaseGate follows). An
// UNRESOLVABLE spec fails CLOSED -- the spell/ability is withheld entirely,
// the same conservative direction phaseGate uses for an unknown trigger
// Phase$ name. Measured at the corpus pin, all 150 ActivationPhases$ lines
// resolve, so the fail-closed branch has zero live population.
//
// The three rider qualifiers on the same lines are read here too, because
// the window is meaningless without the most common ones: ActivationFirstCombat$
// and ActivationAfterBlockers$ narrow the window within combat, and
// PlayerTurn$/OpponentTurn$ name whose turn it must be (PlayerTurn$ was
// already read on the ability-offer loop, but not on the cast half; the
// other three were read nowhere).
//
// One helper serves every gate site -- the cast half through spellTimingOK
// (every zone which offers a spell cast) and the ability half through the
// AB$ offer loop and the mana-ability gate. A future cast-offer site that
// goes through spellTimingOK, as all of them already do, is covered by
// construction rather than by remembering to add a call.
