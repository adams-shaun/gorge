// Ruling T25-b (fix round 1): this used to measure a game that never played
// Magic -- the bot wasted its whole pool tapping mana during the upkeep
// (where it holds priority for the trigger drain), so the pool was empty
// again by main 1 and no creature was ever affordable; combat therefore
// never happened in any of the 60 seeds. With that fixed (sampledecks.go's
// creature now costs one pip, and botDecide/answer only tap mana in a main
// phase), the loop below also asserts, IN AGGREGATE across all 60 seeds,
// that combat actually occurred -- so a future regression that empties the
// gate again fails loudly here instead of silently passing 60 games of
// nothing.
