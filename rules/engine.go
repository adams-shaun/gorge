// Package rules is the authoritative rules engine: turn structure, priority,
// the stack, combat and state-based actions. It owns the only Game instance a
// match has and mutates it exclusively through events.Emit.
//
// The event log is NOT a complete match description by itself. Genesis --
// state.NewGame and the initial AddObject calls that build each player's
// deck into the object arena, both in New below -- runs before the log
// exists and legitimately bypasses events. Replaying L.Events alone
// reconstructs everything that happens from that point on (turn structure,
// zone moves, life, damage, priority and so on), but it can never recover
// deck contents or player names: those are never logged. A faithful replay
// needs the original Config together with the log, not the log alone.
