// endStepCaptureProbe is an inline (never corpus) card shaped after
// Enchanter's Bane minus the imprint, for task rememberedcapture1: an end-step
// phase trigger targets a creature, its controller may sacrifice it, and a
// chained leg is gated `ConditionCheckSVar$ Y | ConditionSVarCompare$ EQ0`
// with `SVar:Y:Remembered$Amount`. With the capture excluded, an unsacrificed
// resolution leaves the remembered set empty, Y reads 0 and EQ0 HOLDS (the leg
// fires). The forced-sacrifice variant writes the sacrificed card into
// Remembered (`RememberSacrificed$ True`), so the same gate must deny -- the
// contrast that proves the read distinguishes "remembered nothing" from
// "remembered one".
//
// The observable is the gated leg's `DB$ Draw`: the probe's controller draws a
// card when and only when the gate holds. The card carries no Imprinted
// reference, so it does not depend on the separate Defined$
// ImprintedController defect (see the report's ## Issues): Enchanter's Bane's
// own damage leg stays dead for that second reason even once this condition
// leg is correct, which is why the acceptance here is the condition semantics,
// not the Bane's damage.
//
// The optional ask in this shape does NOT pose (measured; see the report's
// ## Issues): the engine takes the deterministic decline, so the declined case
// is the no-ask path the real Enchanter's Bane also drives through in triage.
