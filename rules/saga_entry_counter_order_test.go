// Saga entry lore under a non-commuting AddCounter pair (cli-20260924T034908Z).
// A Saga enters with its first lore counter (CR 702.151a), and CR 614.12
// requires the CR 616.1 order choice over competing AddCounter replacements to
// be answered BEFORE the permanent is on the battlefield with that counter:
// the entry move must carry the finalized amount, never fold first and adjust.
// Two LORE-scoped replacements modelled on Hardened Scales (that many plus
// one) and Branching Evolution (twice that many) do not commute -- 1 -> 2 -> 4
// against 1 -> 2 -> 3 -- so the answer, not a fixed total, decides the entered
// lore. Chapter abilities trigger off the lore counter's placement, so a Saga
// entering with a doubled/plus-one counter queues every chapter its final lore
// reaches exactly once.
//
// The ordinary entry path stages exactly this (rules/entry_counters.go
// entryCounterOrderParks -> entryCounterStage -> foldEntryMove): the CR 616.1
// ask is pending while NO MoveZone has folded, the entry then folds with the
// answered amount in its Pairs payload, and the only CounterChange for the
// object is the notification-only EntryCounterNotice marker.

// entryCounterSagaLoreScales is a LORE-scoped "that many plus one" replacement,
// authored inline exactly like Hardened Scales' corpus line so the parser and
// the AddCounter matcher see a real card rather than a hand-shaped event.
