// effect_zone_leak_test.go pins the recurring-Effect matching scope's

//
// checkEventDelayedTriggers armed the read-only matching overlay before each
// registration's own matching but, before the fix, cleared it only there --
// never after the registration loop. An emit whose delayed walk ended on a
// live EffectRepeat registration therefore returned with the overlay still
// armed, and the NEXT matching walk trusted it: controllerOf and the
// trigmatch_zone CR 603.10a look-back guard consult effectMatchControllerFor
// precisely because it is only true inside a registration's matching. The
// concrete casualty is a permanent that (a) holds a live self-Effect
// registration and (b) carries a PRINTED controller-relative dies trigger:
// stolen and destroyed, the printed trigger must read the departing
// permanent's last-known controller (the thief, CR 603.10a) -- under the
// leaked scope it read the registration's owner instead and silently did not
// fire.
