// This file is the ONE bridge between rules' layer walk and the effects tier's
// name comparisons (Forge's named<X>, notnamed<X>, sameName and NamedCard).
//
// A layer-3 SetName$ effect (CR 613.1d) replaces a permanent's name, and only
// the layer walk can say which effect applies and which of two competing
// effects wins on timestamp. The effects tier cannot import rules and must not
// re-derive any of that from a battlefield scan. So rules computes the renames
// itself and hands them down as DATA on the SpecContext the filter call already
// carries -- the same shape SpecContext.ExtraTypes and ExtraKeywords use, and
// deliberately not a callable resolver field (which poisons escape analysis) or
// a back-pointer from state.Game into a live engine (which would make an
// authoritative Game depend on something outside its event fold, and would
// survive a Game.Clone aimed at a different board).
//
// The table is a FIELD, refreshed after each emitted event, and specCtx binds
// it with a plain field read. That is load-bearing, not a style choice: calling
// a function from inside specCtxSVars pushes it over the inline budget, its
// Resolve closure then escapes, and every SpecContext construction on the
// Derived/legal-actions hot path allocates
// (TestDerivedWithContinuousEffectsDoesNotAllocate,
// TestLegalActionsReusesActionStaticMembership). The refresh itself is gated on
// setNameInPool so a match whose cards carry no SetName$ static -- almost every
// match -- pays one predictable branch per event and nothing else.
//
// A filter call with no rules-built context -- effects.MatchesSpecFrom from
// code that owns no resolution Ctx (an Aura entry bearer scan), a bare
// *state.Game, a unit test -- carries no names and reads the printed face.
// That is the same reach ExtraTypes has (see the "Layer-4 type grants reach
// only the layer walk" row in AGENTS.md), and it is pinned by
// TestBareGameNameFilterReadsThePrintedName. Every RESOLVING effect's filter
// call DOES see the names: rules publishes the table to effects at the top of
// every effects.Resolve walk (Engine.EffectiveNames), which binds it on the
// resolving Ctx and propagates it through (*Ctx).SpecContext and Ctx.MatchSpec
// -- see setName_filter_scope_test.go's resolving-effect probe.

// poolHasSetNameStatic reports whether any card this match can put on the
// battlefield prints a SetName$ static. Computed once, at genesis, over the
// decks and the token table: a card outside the pool can never register one of
// these statics from its printed text. The per-card probe is cards.SetsName --
// card-data introspection, deliberately not a statics-parameter read on a
// rules path (rules/paramcensus_test.go attributes those to the primitive
// whose activeStatics root reaches them, and this probe has no such root
// because it runs before any board exists).
