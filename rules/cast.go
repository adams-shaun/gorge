// cannot count one red-and-green creature towards both the red and the green

// as the parts are walked, mirroring exactly what sacAsk offers; a part with
// fewer than N un-reserved candidates makes the whole cost unpayable, so the
// option is never offered (the totality rule an option that cannot be paid

// with a scarcer later part is conservatively withheld (the engine's standing
// rule is that wrongly withholding a legal option is safe, while wrongly
// offering an unpayable one is an illegal game action).
// castable is the ordinary offer gate's price check. The mana half resolves
// through costPayable -- the seat's RESTRICTION-ADJUSTED floating pool
