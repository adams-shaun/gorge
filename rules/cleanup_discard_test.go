// that used to do nothing about an oversized hand must now ask the active
// player to discard down to maxHandSize, and must handle the exactly-at-the-
// limit and non-active cases. The regression tests were written before the
// implementation; each one names the failure it would catch.

// onHand places a card straight into a player's hand, appended after their
// existing hand in hand-zone order, the same direct-setup stance as onBoard
// for the battlefield. A test that needs a player mid-turn to hold more than
// maxHandSize adds a few of these on top of the opening hand.
