// Task m32: CR 903.9, a commander's return to the command zone. A commander
// about to be put into its owner's graveyard, hand or library from anywhere,
// or exiled from anywhere, may instead be put into the command zone by its
// OWNER -- a replacement effect that applies before the object would change
// zones (rules/replacement.go's commanderZoneReplacementApplies +
// parkCommanderZoneMove + handleCmdZone, asked as decision.KCommanderZone).
//
// The five traps CR 903.9 trips on, each pinned by a named test below:
//   - it is a REPLACEMENT EFFECT, not a trigger that moves the card after:
//     the commander never touches the destination zone, and the choice is
//     asked of the owner before anything moves;
//   - "may": the owner may decline, and a decline changes nothing (the
//     original zone change happens unchanged -- and must not re-offer);
//   - "from anywhere": battlefield, stack, graveyard, hand and library are
//     all sources (there is no From restriction);
//   - the four destinations are graveyard, hand, library and exile: a
//     commander moving to the battlefield or the stack is not replaced;
//   - ownership, not control: a stolen commander goes to its owner's
//     command zone and its owner is asked.
//
// Everything is gated on Config.Format == FormatCommander (a Constructed
// game, even one carrying a Commanders config, never runs any of it), and
// the choice is a recorded intent with the resulting MoveZone in the log,
// so a log-only replay reproduces both branches.
