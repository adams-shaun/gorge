// Task 29 (Ruling T26-a): what happens to the ORIGINAL event once a
// replacement matches depends on Forge's ReplacementResult$, which this used
// to ignore entirely -- every match was treated as ReplacementResult$
// Replaced, discarding the original event unconditionally. That is right for
// "Replaced" (and for no ReplacementResult$ at all: Task 22's four pins were
// measured against fixtures with neither, and must keep reading as
// Replaced), but wrong for ReplacementResult$ Updated -- Forge's idiom for
// "the event still happens, augmented" (CR 616.1's "an effect that modifies
// how an event occurs"), which is by far the dominant shape in the corpus:
// 838 of 842 ReplacementResult$-bearing R: lines say Updated, and 835 of
// those are exactly this "enters the battlefield tapped" pattern (Hallowed
// Fountain, Celestial Colonnade, Geralf's Messenger, ...). Treating Updated
// as a full replace discarded the permanent's own MoveZone onto the
// battlefield, so it never left the stack and resolveTop kept re-resolving
// the same object forever (see Task 26's report and the resolveTop guard
