// effPutCounter's `Monstrosity$` read, emitted as an events.AlterAttribute

// rules/legal.go's monstrosityGateOK; this file is the listener trigger.

// COUNT, which the bodies read back as TriggerCount$Amount (Hydra
// Broodmaster's `SVar:MonstrosityX:TriggerCount$Amount`, Vitality Hunter's
// `SVar:MaxTgts:TriggerCount$Amount`) through the BecomeMonstrous referent
// bindings in rules/trigger_referents.go.
