// TestUnlessCostOfferExcludesInstantSpeedSources is the review regression for
// the InstantSpeed$ offer/window mismatch: UnlessCostPayable must compute its
// reach from the SAME membership the mid-resolution window can actually tap,
// so an InstantSpeed$ True mana ability ("Activate only as an instant", Lion's
// Eye Diamond) must not make a {U} tax look payable. Before the fix the offer
// gate folded in AvailableMana, which counts priority-window abilities
// including InstantSpeed$; the window (untappedManaSource / the activation
// gate) withholds them, so Pay was offered with no activation to complete it
// and the payment necessarily declined.
