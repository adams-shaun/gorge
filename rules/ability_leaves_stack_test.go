// stack->exile, and the Face-less ability object used to JOIN its owner's
// exile list: a later "put a card an opponent owns from exile into that
// player's graveyard" cost (Oracle of Dust) then moved it into a graveyard,
// where Delve / an ExileFromGrave cost offered it as a card and dereferenced
// its nil Face. CR 113.7a: an ability that leaves the stack ceases to exist,
// so it must never be a member of any zone's card list.
