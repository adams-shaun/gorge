// putTriggersOnStack drains pendingTriggers onto the stack, asking each
// controller who has two or more of them for the order (CR 603.3b, user
// requirement R1) and asking each optional trigger's decider whether it goes
// on the stack at all (Forge's OptionalDecider$, user requirement R2).
//
// It reports whether it asked a decision and so has NOT finished. A true
// return means e.pending is set: the caller must return immediately without
// granting priority, and the drain is resumed by handleTriggerOrder /
// handleTriggerOptional below, both of which end in resumeTriggerDrain
// (turn.go). It is entered from exactly one place, turn.go's priorityRound,
// and re-entered only through resumeTriggerDrain -- which is itself the
// continuation of that same priorityRound. That is what makes "finish the
// priority round" the one correct continuation for every decision it asks,
// and it is why the resumption goes to grantPriority rather than back through
// priorityRound -- see resumeTriggerDrain's own header (turn.go) for the
// reason that still holds: a second call on priorityRound's path would give
// a replacement-blocked state-based action a second attempt per step and
// move sba.go's measured firing counts (Ruling T22-p). (Ruling T28-b: this
// used to say re-entering priorityRound "would run the draw step's draw a
// second time" -- true before Task 28 moved the draw out of priorityRound
// entirely; the reason above is what actually survives that move.)
//
// ORDERING DIRECTION (Ruling U2, and the one thing here that is silent if it
// is backwards): the ordering decision's choice[0] is the trigger put on the
// stack FIRST, and therefore the trigger that resolves LAST. That is the same
// direction as the between-player rule either side of it -- APNAP puts the
// active player's triggers on the stack first and resolves them last -- so
// one sentence describes the whole placement. The Prompt says so in the
// player's own words, and TestTriggerOrderChoiceDecidesResolutionOrder
// asserts it by the order the two effects actually RUN, not by the order they
// were pushed.
//
// The between-player order is not the player's (Ruling U1): it is CR 603.3b's
// APNAP, kept here as the same sort.SliceStable by controller rank the
// pre-Task-27 version used. Ties within one controller keep checkTriggers'
// discovery order (seat, then zone, then zone position); that is the order the
// options are OFFERED in, and which of them actually goes first is then the
// controller's answer rather than the engine's.
//
// RESUMABILITY (Ruling U3). The queue this walks can grow underneath it.
// Submit runs handle, then checkStateBased, then Advance, and checkStateBased
// (sba.go) is a bounded fixed-point loop that emits PlayerLost, MoveZone and
// GameOver events -- every one of which runs checkTriggers. So a creature
// dying to a state-based action while a controller is being asked to order
// their triggers really does append to e.pendingTriggers between the ask and
// the answer. Three properties make that safe:
//
//   - Appends only ever land at the END of e.pendingTriggers, and a decision
//     is always about entries at the FRONT. Nothing but popFrontTrigger and
//     dropDepartedTriggers ever removes an entry.
//   - e.orderedTriggers counts the leading entries whose order is already
//     settled. While it is non-zero the queue is not re-sorted, so a trigger
//     arriving mid-drain can neither be shuffled into a group the controller
//     has already ordered nor make them order the same triggers twice.
//   - A trigger leaves the queue in the same call that pushes it (or declines
//     it), so nothing can be pushed twice or dropped on the floor.
//
// A trigger that arrives after the group it would have joined was settled
// simply forms the next group, and is still placed before any player receives
// priority -- which is all CR 117.5 asks of it.
//
// CR 800.4a: an ability controlled by a player who has left the game ceases to

// triggering event was about (triggerRemembered, above) -- the same object
// Forge means by both names in every T: line in the corpus that uses them.
//
// CAVEAT (Task 6, fix round 1): that equivalence assumes Remembered[0] is
// the object the FIRING trigger's own T: line is on, which triggerRemembered
// no longer guarantees for a DeclareAttackers-driven Attacks trigger --
// Remembered there is every attacker declared against one defending player
// (handleAttackers emits one event per defender since Task m34), in event
// order, so Remembered[0] is whichever creature attacking that defender was
// declared first, not necessarily pt.Source. No repo-deck T: line combines
// Mode$ Attacks with OptionalDecider$ TriggeredCardController/
// TriggeredSourceController today (measured against the same corpus the
// table above was), so this is a latent gap, not a live one -- but a future
// card that did would have this read the wrong creature's controller
// whenever it attacks alongside another creature that happened to be
// declared first.
//
// LIMITATION, stated rather than assumed: the remaining ten T: lines
// (TriggeredPlayer, EnchantedController, TriggeredAttackingPlayer,
// TriggeredActivator -- 0.7% of the corpus's optional triggers, and none of
// them in a mode this milestone implements) name a player this engine's
// pendingTrigger cannot derive, because events.Event carries no attacking
// player, no activator and no enchant link. Those fall back to asking the
// controller. That still satisfies R2 -- a human is asked, and no outcome is
// assumed -- but it can ask the wrong human, so it is a real gap and not a
