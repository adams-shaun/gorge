// TestForEachObjectReentrySafety pins the re-entry property of forEachObject
// (Task A2). forEachObject snapshots each zone into a scratch buffer before
// walking it, because fn may move objects between zones (a trigger match
// putting something on the stack), and the depth-0 walk reuses the shared
// e.foreachBuf so it settles at the largest zone and stops allocating. If fn
// itself reaches forEachObject again -- directly, or through emit ->
// checkTriggers -- while the outer walk is mid-range, a single shared buffer
// would be a correctness bug: the inner walk would overwrite the outer's
// snapshot and the outer loop would read clobbered ids for the rest of that
// zone. The depth guard hands any re-entrant call its own private buffer, so
// the outer walk is never disturbed.
//
// This test forces exactly that re-entry: the first element of seat 0's four-
// object hand triggers a nested forEachObject, i.e. the outer walk is partway
// through a multi-element zone when the inner walk runs. A preceding warm-up
// walk grows e.foreachBuf to the largest zone's capacity, so both the outer
// hand snapshot and the inner walk's appends share ONE backing array -- the
// exact collision a plain shared buffer exhibits -- which makes the corruption
// deterministic rather than dependent on append's growth coincidences. To
// mutation-test it, remove the `if e.foreachDepth > 1 { buf = nil }` guard
// (and the writeback guard) in trigger_match.go so the re-entrant call reuses
// the shared buffer: the inner walk then overwrites indices 1..3 of the outer
// hand range, the outer loop reads those clobbered ids, and this test fails
// on the seen/want mismatch.

// TestForEachObjectCloneOwnsScratch pins that Engine.Clone does not share the

// while the original walks would corrupt both. A clone is taken at an intent
// boundary -- never mid-walk, so foreachDepth is zero -- and sharing the
// buffer would still be a bug for a future concurrent pair. The structural
// invariant is what makes sharing impossible: Clone deliberately leaves both
// fields zero, so the clone owns a private buffer it grows itself and there
// is nothing shared to corrupt. This test pins that invariant directly: warm
// the original's buffer (proving there is a buffer that COULD be shared),
// clone, and assert the clone's own buffer starts fresh and independent while
// the original's keeps working.
