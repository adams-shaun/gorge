// Task kw-hexproof1: K:Hexproof arrived in the derived keyword set but NO
// rule read it, so the CR 702.11 targeting gate was absent — a hexproof
// permanent (Lotus Field, Tectonic Split, Witchstalker) was offered to every
// targeting spell or ability, its opponents' included. The fix wires
// e.hexproofBlocksTarget into the two targeting gates, candidatesFor (the
// offer census every cast/ability/trigger ask routes through) and
// legalTargets (the CR 608.2b resolution recheck), behind the same
// battlefield-zone gate protection, shroud and CantTarget use. Unlike shroud
// (CR 702.14, symmetric), hexproof is ASYMMETRIC (CR 702.11b): its
// controller may still target it, and a quality-bearing K:Hexproof:<Spec>
// form (CR 702.11c) withholds only against a source carrying that quality.

// darkBlastScript is a black instant that targets only creatures — the
// quality test's black source, paired with the existing shockScript (red).
