// Task tgtowner1: Chaos Warp's exact sub-ability shape, pinned end to end.
// The root poses the target ask (ValidTgts$ Permanent) and chains a DBDig
// sub carrying `Defined$ TargetedOwner` and NO ValidTgts of its own -- the
// shape where, before the grammar learned the spelling, the Dig's player
// list fell back to the resolving SOURCE (the caster) and the caster dug
// their own library instead of the targeted permanent's owner's. The root
// body here is an inert Tap because the shuffle half is not under test (and
// TapOrUntap would pose a mid-resolution tap/untap ask); the
// targeting-and-sub-Dig skeleton is the carrier's.
