// repoCommanderGames is the m38 commander play-evidence table: one real
// Commander game per interim deck, each deck once as seat 0 (the seat whose
// commander the assert requires to actually be cast from the command zone).
// Matchups and seeds are pinned, not arbitrary: seeds are what made each
// game representative when this task measured them (a game that reaches a
// winner with the deck's commander cast). In particular the green deck —
// whose commander's own cost-reduction static this build does not read (see
// the AGENTS.md Known approximations / the m38 report), so Ghalta costs a
// flat 12 — is seated against the slowest of the five (Wretched Ranks).
// Fix round 1 measured under m34 free-for-all combat that whether one
// seeded game assembles twelve mana before it ends is close to a coin flip
// (pre-fix ~2/9 of seeds 1000-1040 cast Ghalta; post-fix the majority of
// seeds 1005-1015 cast it, but 1005-1015 still contains no-cast seeds), so
// the green deck carries a small declared seed set and the cast assert is
// existential over it (every game in the set must still reach a winner and
// replay byte-identically).
