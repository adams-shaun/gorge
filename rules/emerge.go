// emerge.go implements the Emerge alternative cast (CR 702.118a): "You may
// cast this spell by sacrificing a creature and paying the emerge cost reduced
// by that creature's mana value."
//
// Emerge is a CASTING OPTION, read directly off the K: line exactly like the
// Flash/Flashback/Bestow/Mutate/MayFlashCost family (cards/keywords.go's
// expandKeywords doc names it), so it is registered here in its own file as
// those keywords are. It is NOT a plain alternative-cost substitution: the
// cast must sacrifice a chosen creature AND reduce the emerge cost by that
// creature's mana value, so it cannot ride keywordAltCost's
// "pay the printed parameter in place of the mana cost" path. The pieces:
//
//   - emergeCost resolves the printed K:Emerge parameter to a Cost, cutting
//     Forge's colon-suffixed metadata (`K:Emerge:5 B B:Artifact`) and
//     withholding every cost shape beyond generic and coloured mana.
//   - emergeOfferCost checks the reduced cost for each sacrifice candidate.
//     sacAsk permits only candidates whose own reduced payment is payable,
//     so an offer cannot turn into an unpayable choice.
//   - the offer (rules/legal.go's hand walk) adds the "emerged" cast mode,
//     and beginCast's "emerged" arm charges the emerge cost plus the Sac part.
//   - sacAsk applies the chosen creature's mana value as a reduction exactly
//     once, after every Sac part is settled, before the mana window reads
//     pc.cost.
