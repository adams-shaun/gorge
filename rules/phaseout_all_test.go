// Mode$ PhaseOutAll (CR 702.25b): "Whenever one or more other permanents phase
// out ..." (The War Doctor). The batch-level reading is the point: one
// api:Phases resolution that phases out several permanents is ONE occurrence,
// so the trigger fires once for the group, not once per permanent. The test
// drives a real corpus carrier (Guardian of Faith's "any number of other
// target creatures you control phase out") over two real creatures and reads
// the printed PutCounter body's TIME counter on the real The War Doctor.

// Doctor (phase-out-excluded) is not counted, and if the latch were per-event
// the counter would be 2.
