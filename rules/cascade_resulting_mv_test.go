// Task cascade-resulting-mv, fix round. The round-1 premise -- that a
// cascade free cast announces a chosen {X} whose resulting mana value must
// be rechecked against the cascade source's -- was false. CR 107.3b: when a
// player casts a spell with {X} in its mana cost without paying that cost
// (and X isn't defined by the spell's text), X is considered to be 0. The
// "announce X=1 on Villainous Wealth" scenario is therefore not a legal cast
// scenario at all, and the cascadeXAsk the round-1 commit added was itself
// the rules violation: it offered illegal X>0 choices in the election's
// place.
//
// The engine's behavior without that ask is already right, and CR 702.85a's
// strict inequality holds by construction: the exile-until scan compared the
// candidate at its X=0 printed value while it sat in the library (CR
// 202.3b), the free cast poses no X announcement and casts at X=0, so the
// resulting spell's mana value is the same X=0 value the scan qualified --
// strictly below the cascade source's. The regression pins exactly that on
// the real corpus pair: accepting the election poses CR 601.2c's target ask
// and no value-of-X choice anywhere in the cast, and the candidate resolves.
