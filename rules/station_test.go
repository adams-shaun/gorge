// fb-20260916T022949Z-10e9a496: the Hearthhull feedback. The Station
// implementation itself landed with the mass-turn/new-mechanics merge
// (rules/station.go); these tests pin the integration on the reported card --
// Hearthhull, the Worldseed -- and close the gaps the landed tests left: the
// negative offer gates and the KChoose continuation across Engine.Clone.

// choice is taken while a KChoose is pending, so the continuation survives an
