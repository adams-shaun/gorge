// unlessManaWindowNeeded reports whether a mana-only unless cost should open
// the CR 601.2g mana-activation window: the cost has a mana component, the
// payer's pool (under the payment's own conversion set) cannot already pay
// it, and the payer controls at least one untapped mana source the window
// could supply. An already-payable cost, a non-mana cost, or a payer with no
// untapped source keeps today's exact path (charge straight from the pool),
// so no existing game moves merely because the window exists.
//
// Before this the mid-resolution unless arm charged the floating pool only:
// a payer with an untapped source and an empty pool could never pay, and a
// converted colour (CR 106.6, stat:ManaConvert) could never be produced by
// tapping.

// conversion -- and re-enters the asking SA with ctx.UnlessPay set, exactly
// as the arm's ordinary pool-only charge does.
