// attack_defender.go implements the CanAttackDefender permission static
// (CR 702.3b's effect half: "can attack as though it didn't have defender").
//
// The wall itself is canAttack's HasKeyword("Defender") check
// (rules/combat.go); this file is the READ that lifts it pair by pair:
//
//   - a face static (`S:Mode$ CanAttackDefender | ValidCard$ ...` — Felothar
//     the Steadfast's Creature.YouCtrl, Weathered Sentinels' Card.Self) is
//     enforced per (attacker, defender) pair through the activeStatics walk
//     with the shared gate grammar, the same shape attackPairCharge
//     (rules/attack_cost.go) uses for CantAttackUnless;
//   - an Effect-granted body (Assault Formation's AB$ Effect delivering
//     `SVar:CanAttack:Mode$ CanAttackDefender | ValidCard$
//     Creature.IsRemembered`) registers as a ContinuousEffect with
//     Restriction "CanAttackDefender" (effects/misc.go's effEffect case) and
//     is consulted through the same ContinuousEffect walk attackBlocked's
//     CantAttack loop takes, so the restrictionApplies machinery binds the
//     remembered target.
//
// Both routes are consulted at the ONE choke point canAttackPair puts around
// the Defender keyword; a creature without Defender never reaches this file.
//
// ValidAttacked$ (Weathered Sentinels'
// `Player.attackedYouTheirLastTurn`) is the defender-side gate: the static
// lifts the wall only against defenders who attacked the static's controller
// during THEIR last turn. The record of who attacked whom lives in the log
// (events.DeclareAttackers' Player IS the defender — rules/combat.go
// finishAttackers groups one event per defending player), so the read is a
// pure log scan with no state, rebuilt identically by replay: the same
// shape foretellCastAvailable (rules/altcast.go) takes for the same reason.
