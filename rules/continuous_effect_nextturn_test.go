// TestEffectContinuousExpiresAtEndOfNextTurn pins the turn-boundary lifetime
// of a Duration$ UntilTheEndOfYourNextTurn effect -- fix F1, and the largest
// non-Permanent Duration$ population (105 raw lines / 105 compiled SAs). The
// restriction must survive the CURRENT turn's cleanup AND the opponent's
// turn, stay live through the controller's NEXT turn, and only then expire:
// it is neither a premature end-of-this-turn expiry (UntilEOT, the shape the
// instant-source branch used to give it a turn early) nor a never-expiring
// source-leaves effect. Driving the real turn/card flow and observing the
// registry's own expiry turn is the boundary measurement.
//
// Like its end-of-turn sibling (continuous_effect_lifetime_test.go) this
// reads the engine's own restriction registry -- restrictionBlocksTarget and
// the ContinuousEffect.UntilTurn field, both new on this branch -- so it is a
// "passes here" boundary pin rather than a base-compile proof. The card-flow
// fail-on-base proof that the restriction is real at all is the Vines test
// (same Duration$ shape, Permanent); the new thing here is the boundary.
