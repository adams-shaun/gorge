// Task repeatopt1: the RepeatOptional$ do/while election. Ad Nauseam is the
// named corpus carrier (its brief source), and Forbidden Ritual is the
// corpus carrier whose BODY itself asks (a sacrifice resolving into a
// GenericChoice modal ask), which is the shape a resumed body must return
// to the election for -- never fall straight into the next iteration.
//
// The two carriers pin the two distinct resume states:
//   - Ad Nauseam: the body does not ask, so the loop reaches the election
//     directly. Guards the base fix (the election is posed at all, and "no"
//     stops after exactly one iteration).
//   - Forbidden Ritual: the body SUSPENDS on its own ask. When that body
//     completes after the answer, the next decision must be the repeat
//     election for the NEXT iteration, not that iteration's body. This is
//     the state RepeatOptionalContinuation.AskElection names.
