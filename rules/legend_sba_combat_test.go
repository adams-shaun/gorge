// Ticket cli-20260922T225140Z-68ca4d95, fix round 2: the CR 704.5j legend
// choice is a STATE-BASED-action decision, and the SBA pass can be reached
// from inside a combat-damage tail that then poses its own priority round.
// Before this fix that tail overwrote the legend ask and -- because the SBA
// pass halts while a batch is parked -- no state-based action ever applied
// again for the rest of the match. These tests pin the two halves: the
// combat-damage tails DEFER to the ask, and a parked batch whose ask is lost
// re-poses it rather than wedging.
