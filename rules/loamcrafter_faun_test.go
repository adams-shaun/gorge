// Loamcrafter Faun's "when you do" chain end to end (task
// agent-20260918T195920Z-2fd3b568, the ticket that registered
// api:ImmediateTrigger originally filed under):
//
//	When CARDNAME enters, you may discard one or more land cards. When you do,
//	return up to that many target nonland permanent cards from your graveyard
//	to your hand.
//
// The chain is DB$ Discard | AnyNumber$ True | Optional$ True | Mode$ TgtChoose
// | RememberDiscarded$ True, then DB$ ImmediateTrigger | ConditionDefined$
// Remembered | ConditionCompare$ GE1 | RememberObjects$ Remembered | Execute$
// TrigReturn, whose SVar:X:TriggerRemembered$Amount sizes TargetMax$ X.
//
// These tests run on the REAL compiled corpus card only -- no Forge script
// text is committed here (the licensing rule) -- fetched by name through
// searchCorpusCard. The ticket's residual defect was that TriggerRemembered
// was not a count ref at all, so X read zero, changeZoneChosenTargets' explicit
// zero bound skipped the ask entirely, and the graveyard cards never came
// back. The first test pins the whole flow; the second pins the empty-discard
// no-op the brief calls out (0 discarded -> X = 0 -> no ask, no wedge).

// loamcrafterEngine seats seat 0 a deck headed by Loamcrafter Faun, drives to
// Main 1, puts `lands` Forests into seat 0's hand, `graveyard` Grizzly Bears
// into seat 0's graveyard, and moves Loamcrafter Faun from hand/library onto
// the battlefield -- firing its ChangesZone ETB. It returns the engine parked
// wherever that trigger (or the test's own driving) left it, plus the moved
// ids. The board is deterministic: the moves are explicit logged MoveZone
