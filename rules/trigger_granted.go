// checkGrantedWard/checkGrantedDethrone precedent -- a granted triggered
// ability has the same rules text a printed one would, and the face walk
// above only ever scans printed T: lines. The grants live on the memoised
// static scan (active()); each Affected$-matched grant is matched against
// the event exactly as a printed trigger would be (triggerMatches, which
// resolves the granted body's own TriggerZones$/ValidPlayer$/Phase$ clauses)
// and queued with its SVar-resolved SA -- the pendingTrigger shape the
// granted-keyword paths use, pushed through events.GrantTriggerPush.
//
// The queue gate is the live==replay contract: the stack object is minted
// inside events.Apply, which resolves the Execute$ body from the GRANTOR's
// own SVar table (the object carrying the printed static, threaded to the
// event as Amount; 0 = the self-grant shape, where grantor == recipient), so
// the walk links the effect from that same table (the resolveSVarAcrossFaces
// walk mirrored in grantedTriggerExecute) and a grant whose body it cannot
// produce never queues -- the conservative direction, matching the
// replayable-log invariant rather than minting an ability a replay cannot
// rebuild. A self-grant (Hearthhull) trivially satisfies it, and so does a
// cross-object grant (an Aura granting its enchanted creature a trigger): the
// Execute$ SVar lives on the GRANTOR's face, which is ce.Source -- except for
// the Animate route, whose Source is the ANIMATED object and whose grantor
// the effect names via TriggerGrantor (the animating card's table).
//
// Fire-count: like Ward and Dethrone, every granted trigger shares the
// granted slot's triggerKey (Source, Idx -1) -- the cascade bound only, not
// once-per-turn memory, and maxTriggerFires (256) is generous enough that
// the sharing cannot starve a legitimate fire. Like those two the walk is
// deliberately a read over active()'s sorted slice, never a map: the queue
// order stays the scan's deterministic order.
// split/leaving are the face walk's two passes, passed through so the
// leaves-the-battlefield look-back discipline applies to granted triggers
// exactly as to printed ones (see the loop body): the look-back pass runs
// only a battlefield-origin ChangesZone trigger, the live pass only the
// rest -- a gate the first gains round omitted, which queued a gained "dies"
// trigger once per pass and fired it twice.
//
// statics is the event's PREFILTERED grant list (grantedTriggerStaticsFor):
// only the active statics carrying a granted trigger whose Mode$ can observe
// this event's kind, in active()'s order. The prefilter is exact, not a
// heuristic: triggerMatches' first gate is the same triggerModeEvents mask,
// and every check the loops below run before it (Affected$ match, the batch
