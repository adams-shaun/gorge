// trig:FullyUnlock's leaf (task agent-20260919T191104Z-95f1e316): the Eerie
// enchantments' "whenever ... you fully unlock a Room" half, driven by the
// REAL corpus Fear of Sleep Paralysis and the real two-door Defiled Crypt /
// Cadaver Lab. The tests live in their own file (never appended to the Room
// leaves in mass_primitives_test.go) so a concurrent ticket cannot collide on
// the same test file.
