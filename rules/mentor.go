// Mentor (CR 702.134)'s target restriction.
//
// cards/kw_mentor.go expands printed K:Mentor into an ordinary Mode$ Attacks
// trigger whose body is a targeted PutCounter carrying the Mentor$ marker,
// and checkGrantedMentorTriggers synthesizes the same body for a layer-6
// AddKeyword$ Mentor grant. The restriction -- "target attacking creature
// with LESSER power" -- is the strict power comparison this file owns.
//
// It is deliberately NOT written as a powerLTX target spec. A target spec's
// numeric RHS resolves through targetSpecContext's Resolve, which reads the
// announced {X} (a cast's e.cast.x, or the stack object's o.X) and never the
// source face's SVar:X; Unliving Psychopath's own `Creature.powerLTX` with
// `SVar:X:Count$CardPower` therefore offers an EMPTY target list. Keeping the
// comparison in one shared helper -- called by the target offer and by the
// CR 608.2b resolution recheck -- means offer and recheck cannot disagree
// (Critical C2's one-definition rule).
