// Task 13 fix round 1, review finding "Important 1": TestHeads and
// TestRepoDecksPlayAtEverySeatCount passing unchanged after api:Token's
// registration proved nothing about whether the primitive actually
// resolves end-to-end in a real game. Two of the ratchet's own
// api:Token-carrying cards ARE drawn into the acceptance games those tests
// play -- Batterskull (death-n-taxes, every seat count 2/4/6/8) and Empty
// the Warrens (the-epic-storm, 8 seats) -- so the unchanged chain heads
// mean the testbot never chose to cast either one, not that Token has any
// coverage there. This file closes that gap with a direct, real-corpus
// integration test.
//
// The real Batterskull card and the real b_0_0_phyrexian_germ token
// definition both come from the compiled corpus registry at test time --
// never copied into this file. Even the expected token name is read back
// from the registry's own token definition (germDef.Faces[0].Name) rather
// than hardcoded, so nothing here repeats Forge's own script text.

// actually lands on the battlefield under the casting player's control
// (api:Token's own job), and Ctx.Remembered carries that token far enough
// for the trigger's chained SubAbility$ -- __kwLWAttach, `DB$ Attach |
// Defined$ Remembered | Object$ Self` -- to actually run and hit
// Resolve's "unimplemented API" fallback (Attach is Task 14's job, not
// registered yet). That Note is today's correct, honest outcome; once Task
// 14 registers Attach, this test's last assertion should flip to checking
// the token is actually attached instead of checking the fallback fired.
