// creature enters this turn, you may draw a card"). Before this landed such a
// trigger was withheld with a loud "unmodelled Effect trigger OptionalDecider$"
// Note, because registering it would fire the body MANDATORILY -- the opposite
// of the card text. It is now registered like any other Effect trigger and the
// election is posed when the minted ability resolves (rules' resolveTop, the
// CR 603.5 optional gate), to the seat the card names.
//
// The carrier is the real corpus card Beck (Beck // Call), whose
// `A:SP$ Effect | Triggers$ CreatureEntered` names the optional ChangesZone
// body. Its registration is an EffectRepeat one, so it survives each firing
// and the SAME game exercises both branches: an accepted election runs the
// body (a draw), a declined one does not.
