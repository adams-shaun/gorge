// TestTitanOfLittjaraDrawXPayAskCountedOnce is the end-to-end ask-count pin on
// the ticket's canonical carrier (Titan of Littjara's `Cost$ Draw<X/You>`
// trigger body). TestTitanOfLittjaraDrawXCost asserts the STRUCTURAL shape --
// the ask right after the answered pay election is the body's discard
// (ResumeKind "discard") -- which cannot see a LATE re-entry that poses a
// second pay ask AFTER the body has already run. This test walks the whole
// resolution instead and counts every decision that offers `trigger_cost_pay`,
// so a duplicate window anywhere in the chain (before OR after the body) fails.
//
// The window machinery poses its ONE election through the shared
// startTriggeredEffectCost / triggeredCostPaymentAsk call site
// (rules/cumulative.go), which every arming call site funnels through, so this
// real-corpus carrier exercises the single-ask guarantee for the whole
// T:$Execute$-names-an-AB$-with-Cost$ shape (819 corpus files) rather than a
// synthetic construction.
