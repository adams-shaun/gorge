// vanilla lord's global pump) actually applies instead of silently doing
// nothing. Task 14 is what first wires static text into the layer system:
// until it, every S: line this build cared about was a play restriction
// (CantBeCast etc.), and the Mode$ Continuous statics every creature-lord
// and echo of Equipment/Enchant text carries were parsed but never turned
// into an effect -- a card with nothing but static text read as "does
// nothing".
//
// Reading these live off the battlefield permanent (the same scan activeStatics
// performs for restrictions) rather than registering them at ETB means a
// permanent placed on the battlefield by any path -- cast, a raw MoveZone in
// a test -- is covered, the effect expiry problem is solved for free (active()
// only walks battlefield permanents, so a departed source contributes nothing
// this call), and there is no registration event to keep in step with replay.
// Each static breaks into one effect per layer it touches -- AddPower/
// AddToughness is a layer-7 modify, AddKeyword a layer-6 grant, AddTypes a
// layer-4 type change -- so the layer ordering Derived applies (CR 613) still
// holds when one static carries both a pump and a keyword (exactly the Sword
// of Fire and Ice / Umezawa shape Task 14's tests build). The scan order is
// deterministic: AliveFrom(0) walks seats in fixed APNAP order, each
// battlefield zone is a slice, and each face's Statics is its parsed script

// order stays reproducible run to run (determinism requirement 3 of the
