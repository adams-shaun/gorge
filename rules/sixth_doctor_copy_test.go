// isn't legendary." CopySpellAbility's copy previously kept the original's

// The rider is carried on the StackCopy event's Counter (a field StackCopy
// otherwise leaves empty) and folded by events.Apply into Object.CopyNonLegendary

// rules' typeCharacteristics applies as a layer-4 base strip. No event field is
// added or reordered.

// The fixture carries the real corpus card's SpellCast trigger line and its
// TrigCopy SVar VERBATIM (.cards/cardsfolder/t/the_sixth_doctor.txt), on the
// real card. The 4-seat/constructed harness cannot easily pay {4}{G}{U}, so the
// card is moved onto the battlefield directly and a cheap legendary creature
// spell is cast under it.
