// TestAskRejectsMisindexedDecision is the proof that the Option.Index / list
// position identity (finding bi) is enforced at the engine's choke point --
// Engine.ask -- and not only in the decision.New constructor that only two
// construction sites reach. A Decision whose Options[i].Index != i makes a
// client's intent and Chosen resolve a DIFFERENT option than the one named;
// ask is the one place every decision that can reach a seat flows (it sets
// the pending decision), so a guard there covers every construction site at
// once -- the struct literals in rules/combat.go, cast.go, stack.go, turn.go,
// trigger_queue.go and the two mid-resolution asks in effects/ -- whether or
// not a future edit remembers to call decision.New. This test drives a
// deliberately mis-indexed struct-literal Decision through ask and asserts
// it is rejected; it does not use decision.New, because a test that only
// calls New proves nothing about the sites that build the struct literal.
