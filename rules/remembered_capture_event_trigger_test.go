// eventCaptureProbe is an inline (never corpus) card for task
// rememberedcapture1, covering the EVENT-OBJECT capture path that
// rules.resolvingRemembered does NOT mask. resolvingRemembered (added on main
// for Tombstone Stairwell) rewrites only a printed Mode$ Phase trigger's
// resolution ctx, where the capture is the trigger's own source. An
// event-object trigger -- here a ChangesZone trigger whose fire-time capture is
// the entering CREATURE (ev.Obj), distinct from this enchantment source --
// still reaches effects with Remembered == Captured == [entering creature], so
// a plain Remembered$Amount read counts it unless the shared capture-exclusion
// helper removes it. The gated leg is a DB$ Draw: it fires when and only when
// the EQ0 gate holds, i.e. when nothing was actually remembered.
