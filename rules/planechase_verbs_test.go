// end-to-end pin for the planechase verbs. Path of the Ghosthunter is the one
// "Will of the Planeswalkers" card whose whole resolution walks through all
// three gaps at once: SP$ Token -> DBSpace (DB$ BlankLine) -> DBVote
// (DB$ Vote, Choices$ DBPlaneswalk,DBChaos, VoteTiedAbility$ DBChaos), whose
// winning outcome is DB$ Planeswalk -- which before this build emitted
// "unimplemented API BlankLine" and then resolved nothing at all, because
// effVote's fixed-list shape did not run its winner.
//
// Asserted together: the X-token sub-ability still runs (two 1/1 Spirits for
// X=2), the vote records its Notes, the chosen outcome resolves as the
// documented no-planar-deck degrade, and no "unimplemented API" Note is
// emitted anywhere in the log. replayCheck certifies the whole chain still
// replays byte-identically.
