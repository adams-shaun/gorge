// TestDismantleDestroysCounteredTargetAndPlacesCounters is the ordinary
// destruction path for Dismantle (the destructible counterpart of
// TestDismantleCounterTypeChoiceContinuesAfterDeterministicRecipient, which
// deliberately uses an indestructible target). Dismantle's Destroy moves the
// targeted artifact to the graveyard before DBPutCounter evaluates BOTH
// `ConditionDefined$ Targeted | ConditionPresent$ Card.HasCounters` and
// `X:Targeted$CardCounters.ALL`; both must read the target's
// last-known-information counters (CR 608.2b/h), which the engine now
// captures at the start of resolution (Ctx.TargetCountersLKI). The test
// proves the target really was destroyed (so the counters are gone from the
// live object) AND two counters of the chosen kind landed on the caster's
// recipient -- i.e. the gate was met and the amount survived the move.
