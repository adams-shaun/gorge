// Livelock detection: a real bug -- I-1's stack object that re-resolved
// forever, and the rakdos-muscle-scam-exe run that pegged a core for 15+
// minutes with no output -- presents to a harness as a game that never
// returns from Advance/Submit. An outside `timeout` cannot tell "stuck"
// from "slow" and reports nothing about WHERE the loop is, so the engine
// itself watches its own event stream and aborts (panics with a
// *LivelockError) the moment the stream looks non-terminating.
//
// The watcher is pure observation: it reads only the events the engine
// already logged, holds no state events depend on, and never emits an
// event, so a game that does not trip it is byte-identical to an
// un-watched one (the chain-head goldens in rules/heads_test.go pin that).
// A game that DOES trip it is a bug by definition -- the harnesses
// (cmd/mtgsim, cmd/botbench) recover the panic, report the diagnostic
// against that game's seed/deck, and move on; anywhere else the panic is
// the bug surfacing, exactly as the determinism invariant intends.
//
// Two independent triggers, because two loop shapes evade each other:
//
//   - Repeating cycle: the trailing window of event signatures repeats a
//     short period exactly. This catches I-1's shape (the same 13-event
//     resolve cycle over and over) and stays precise enough to report the
//     cycle itself. Signatures deliberately EXCLUDE Seq, Amount and Text:
//     a stuck loop whose payload drifts a little each iteration (a life
//     total ticking down, a counter creeping) must still be caught, while
//     zone/object/step identity still separates genuinely different
//     events.
//
//   - Runaway resolution: this many events with no DecisionAsk, StepChange
//     or TurnChange among them. This is the catch-all for loops whose
//     cycle grows (a new object minted every iteration, a period past
//     MaxPeriod) that the exact-period detector cannot lock onto. Every
//     legitimate game relents and asks a decision or moves to the next
//     step far inside this bound (measured: max quiet run over the
//     acceptance games is three orders of magnitude smaller).
