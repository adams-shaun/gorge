// Task approx-player-shroud: the AGENTS.md "Known approximations" row —
// PLAYER shroud (`Affected$ You` + `AddKeyword$ Shroud`, True Believer,
// Ivory Mask) was unread: players had no ObjID and no keyword machinery, so
// a player with granted shroud stayed targetable by everything. The fix
// gives players a derived keyword surface (rules/playerkeywords.go,
// playerKeywords over the shared layer walk) and wires CR 702.18 shroud and
// CR 702.11 hexproof into both targeting gates — candidatesFor's player arm
// (the offer census) and legalTargets's player arm (the CR 608.2b resolution
// recheck) — exactly where the same keywords bind a permanent.
//
// Every test here is driven by the real corpus cards the row names (True
// Believer, Ivory Mask) or by the same-shaped player-hexproof carriers
// (Leyline of Sanctity); each asserts its own precondition — the granting
// card IS on the battlefield and the grant DID reach the player keyword
// surface, and the compared values actually differ (the control engine
// without the grant still offers and resolves the player target).
