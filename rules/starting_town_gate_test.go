// Task fb-20260918T073138Z-1ccd3f2d: Starting Town enters tapped on the
// first three turns. The corpus card's ETB-tapped replacement gates on
// SVar:X:Count$Compare Y GE1.Z.4 with
// SVar:Y:PlayerCountPropertyYou$HasPropertyActive and SVar:Z:Count$YourTurns
// — tapped only when X > 3, i.e. untapped on your first, second and third
// turns of the game (CR 305.7's "enters tapped unless" family). The sole
// defect was the PlayerCountPropertyYou$HasPropertyActive count head
// (unresolvable, Y=0), which took the Compare's ifFalse branch 4 on every
// turn and held the GT3 gate always; effects/count.go now resolves the head.
//
// Card text below is authored for this test in the same R:/SVar$ shape as
// the corpus card — never copied from Forge's .cards/cardsfolder (GPL).
