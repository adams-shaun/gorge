// miracle.go implements the Miracle keyword (CR 702.93), Task 18.
//
// Miracle is not a triggered ability in the T: sense -- it has no trigger
// line to fire -- but it shares the trigger machinery's queue: when a card
// with Miracle is the FIRST draw of its controller's turn, the draw is what
// offers it, and the controller chooses whether to cast it for the miracle
// cost. The draw still resolves as a normal draw (the card is already in
// hand); what Miracle adds is a yes/no offer layered on top.
//
// The offer is queued as a pendingTrigger with Miracle set and no Idx/SA (no
// T: line), so the drain (putTriggersOnStack, trigger_queue.go) treats it as
// an optional trigger whose decider is the owner: optionalDecider and
// triggerLabel special-case Miracle, askTriggerOptional asks the yes/no, and
// a yes routes pushTrigger into castMiracle below. A no drops the offer
// silently -- declining costs nothing and changes nothing but the offer.

// "First draw of the turn" is derived from the log (drawsThisTurn, below) --
// never from a field that only lives in memory -- so a log-only replay
// reaches exactly the same conclusion. The card is owned by ev.Player (the
// draw moved it from that player's library to their hand, so the object's
// Controller at this instant is also that player; ev.Player is the source of
// truth the brief's interface names).
//
// The offer is queued as a trivial Miracle pendingTrigger. Idx/SA are zero/
// nil (there is no T: line); the drain and decider read the Miracle flag
// instead. The card at this point is guaranteed to be in the owner's hand
// (the draw just put it there); castMiracle re-verifies before it casts, in
// case the offer is still in the queue when something else moves the card.

// stealing a second attempt at state-based actions. drainAwaitsTarget is the
