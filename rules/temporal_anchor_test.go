// The Temporal Anchor (task scrybottom) is the corpus's one carrier of
// "Whenever you choose to put one or more cards on the bottom of your
// library while scrying, exile that many cards from the bottom of your
// library." Its two halves are the scry trigger (`T:Mode$ Scry |
// ValidPlayer$ You | ToBottom$ True`, matched against the completed
// events.Scry record) and the amount (`SVar:X:TriggerCount$ScryBottom`,
// read by `DB$ Dig | DigNum$ X | FromBottom$ True`).
//
// The tests pin the two answers a scry can give against the REAL card body:
// keep every looked-at card on top -> the ToBottom$ True gate sees a
// zero-card bottom pile and fires nothing; put one or more on the bottom ->
// exactly one trigger, sized by the number bottomed (NOT the number looked
// at), exiling that many from the BOTTOM of the library. The measured
// corpus population at the pin is 1 file carrying `T:Mode$ Scry` with
// `ToBottom$ True` and 20 files carrying `T:Mode$ Scry`
// (`/usr/bin/grep -rlIE` over .cards/cardsfolder).
