// The Class level band (kw:Class, CR 702.118). The cards package's kwClass
// expansion appends each level's granted body to the face and stamps the body
// with a dedicated ClassBand$ N parameter; this file holds the ONE evaluator
// every gate family calls beside its own IsPresent$ read, so a granted body is
// live exactly while its source Class carries at least N LEVEL counters.
//
// Why a dedicated parameter rather than IsPresent$: the band is a SELF-check
// of the source permanent (it counts the source object, not the battlefield),
// while a body that carries its own IsPresent$ counts an unrelated set. The
// trigger gate reads IsPresent$+IsPresent2$ as a UNION (the "Name Sticker"
// Goblin two-set clause), so folding the band into IsPresent2$ ORed it with the
// body's own condition -- Hunter's Talent's level-3 end-step draw fired at
// level 1 with a power-4 creature out -- and replacementConditionHolds reads no
// IsPresent2$ at all, so the band vanished there. ClassBand$ has no other
// meaning, so every family can AND it in without colliding with a body clause.
