// Round 2 of cli-20260923T060218Z: a Static$ True body cannot carry the
// OptionalDecider$ election. rules' checkEventDelayedTriggers resolves a
// static-marked delayed registration INLINE at fire time -- never minting a
// stack object -- so resolveTop's CR 603.5 optional gate cannot pose the
// yes/no there, and registering such a body would execute the "you may"
// mandatorily. effEffect withholds the shape with a loud Note, and the static
// firing arm carries a matching fail-closed guard for any future "|OD="
// minter.

// TestEffectOptionalStaticTriggerIsWithheld drives the registration side: an
// api:Effect whose Triggers$ body carries BOTH Static$ True and
// OptionalDecider$ must be withheld with the loud withhold Note and must not
// reach the delayed set (where the static arm would run it mandatorily).
