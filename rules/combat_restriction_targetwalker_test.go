// approx combatrestriction1 (the walker Target$ half): a combat-restriction
// Target$ list's Planeswalker.<player-spec> clause is read by
// restrictionPlayerTargetMatches (rules/layers.go), which both enforcement
// call sites consume — attackBlocked (the CantAttack read behind the offer
// filter and validateAttackers) and attackPairCharge (the CantAttackUnless
// pricing read). These tests bind the walker clause to BOTH call sites:
//
//   - the corpus carrier (Vow of Lightning's
//     `Target$ You,Planeswalker.YouCtrl`) through attackBlocked with the
//     static live on the table;
//   - a walker-ONLY Target$ through attackBlocked, where the walker clause is
//     the sole operative half — the shape the You half of the Vow's comma
//     list cannot discriminate (with the Vow, `You` already blocks the vow's
//     controller, so deleting the walker matcher changes no attackBlocked
//     verdict a Vow-only test could see);
//   - the real corpus carrier of the walker-only shape (Onakke Oathkeeper's
//     `Target$ Planeswalker.YouCtrl | Cost$ 1`) through attackPairCharge.
//
// Each test asserts its own precondition: the carrier is on the battlefield
// with the Vow attached where the static read needs it, the walker is a
// battlefield planeswalker under the clause's controller, and a
// non-planeswalker permanent does not satisfy the clause.
