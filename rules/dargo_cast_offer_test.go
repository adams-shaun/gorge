// fb-20260923T005805Z-1301f55a: the cast-offer affordability gate for a cost
// whose announced Sac<X/Spec> count drives a ReduceCost static. Dargo, the
// Shipwrecker is the named corpus carrier (SVar:X:Count$xPaid over
// SVar:Y:SVar$X/Times.2). Before the fix the ordinary cast option was priced
// with the pre-announcement modifier snapshot (X=0), so a player who could
// only afford the cast AFTER sacrificing got no option at all.
