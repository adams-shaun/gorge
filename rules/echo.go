// Echo (kw:Echo, CR 702.35a: "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this
// permanent came under your control since the beginning of your most recent
// upkeep, you may pay {cost}. If you don't, sacrifice it.") is expanded by
// cards into an ordinary beginning-of-upkeep Phase trigger — the Cumulative
// upkeep shape — so it is ordered and placed with every other upkeep trigger
// and can be responded to before it resolves. This file owns three pieces:
//
//   - the intervening-if (CR 603.4): triggerMatches's Phase branch checks
//     Echo$ True against echoGateHolds BEFORE the trigger stacks, so a
//     permanent whose acquisition predates its controller's most recent
//     upkeep never goes on the stack at all (the gate is a trigger
//     condition, not a resolution-time choice — a stacked-but-suppressed
//     echo would be an observable divergence);
//   - the provenance the gate reads: Object.AcqTurn/AcqStep stamped by
//     events.Apply on every battlefield entry and every battlefield control
//     change, against Player.LastUpkeepTurn recorded when the Draw step
//     begins (see the StepChange case in events/apply.go for why the record
//     is the Draw step and not the Upkeep one);
//   - the resolution-time election: pay the echo cost through the shared
//     pool-only payment window (paymentManaAsk/costPayable/payManaConv,
//     reused verbatim from rules/cumulative.go), or sacrifice. The pay
//     option is offered FIRST when payable (a bot's clamp fallback takes
//     option 0 — pay is the sane default) and the sacrifice option is
//     always present, so nobody is ever wedged.
//
// chooseEcho sits above the shared package enum's current highest
// (chooseRiot = 20); the numbers only need to differ, per the chooseFor
// contract — transient engine RAM, Clone copies the struct, no event or wire
// field ever carries one.
