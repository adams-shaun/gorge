	// The coverage census: kw:MayFlashSac is implemented as a casting
	// permission plus an ETB cleanup hook, both read directly off the K: line
	// (the Flash/Bestow/Mutate/MayFlashCost family -- see rules/mayflash.go's
	// doc), so it is registered here in its own file exactly as bestow.go and
	// mutate.go register theirs. Proof: the sorcery-speed and instant-window
	// casts of Necromancy in rules/mayflashsac_test.go.

// MayFlashSac (Forge's K:MayFlashSac) is the whole CR 702.8 "you may cast
// this as though it had flash" permission together with the keyword's own
// self-sacrifice rider:
//
//	K:MayFlashSac
//	  "You may cast Necromancy as though it had flash. If you cast it any time
//	   a sorcery couldn't have been cast, the controller of the permanent it
//	   becomes sacrifices it at the beginning of the next cleanup step."
//
// The keyword takes NO colon parameter -- unlike MayFlashCost (rules/mayflash.go),
// which charges an additional cost for the permission, this one is free and
// bears the consequence instead. Both halves are therefore read directly by
// rules rather than expanded onto the face (the Flash/Flashback/Bestow/Mutate
// family cards/keywords.go's expandKeywords doc names): there is no face
// ability to add. The pieces:
//
//   - mayFlashSacPermission makes spellTimingOK accept the cast at instant
//     timing, exactly like the printed Flash keyword. No extra cost is folded
//     into the offer.
//   - mayFlashSacCastThisWay reports whether a just-announced cast is the
//     off-sorcery shape the rider keys on: the face carries the keyword AND
//     the cast was not made at a time a sorcery could have been cast. It is
//     captured at beginCast (before CR 601.2a puts the spell on the stack, so
//     the stack-emptiness half of sorcerySpeed is the pre-cast board state,
//     not this spell's own push) and stamped onto the pay-time CastInfo as
//     state.FlagMayFlashSac -- the replayable provenance the ETB hook reads.
//   - mayFlashSacEnter (called from altCostEnter for every battlefield entry)
//     reads that flag and registers the delayed sacrifice at the next cleanup
//     step, through the ordinary DelayedRegister/DelayedPush machinery with
//     the builtin __kwMayFlashSacrifice SVar. A sorcery-timed cast carries no
//     flag, so it registers nothing and the permanent stays.

// mayFlashSacFace reports whether f prints K:MayFlashSac. A nil face, or one
// whose keyword is absent, is false -- the permission and the rider both key
// off the same read, so they cannot disagree about which cards carry it.

// offSorceryAtCast captures the CR 702.8 rider's condition at announcement
// time: true when the cast was made at a time a sorcery could NOT have been
// cast. It is evaluated in beginCast, before the spell is pushed (CR 601.2a),
// so sorcerySpeed's empty-stack half reflects the board the caster announced
// into rather than the spell being announced. An ability proposal (pc.ability
// >= 0) never carries the keyword flag, so the caller gates on the face.

// the permanent it becomes" the oracle text names. One DelayedRegister event
