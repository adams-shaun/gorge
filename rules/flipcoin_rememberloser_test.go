// fluxLoserSrc is Unleash the Flux's chain -- each player sacrifices a nonland
// permanent, then you flip a coin with RememberLoser$ True -- lifted onto an
// activated ability with a reader of the remembered loser chained after it.
//
// The real carrier cannot drive this test: Unleash the Flux is a Phenomenon
// whose T:Mode$ PlaneswalkedTo trigger can never fire in a build with no
// planar deck, and its repeat gate reads the count head
// PlayerCountRemembered$HasPropertyYou, which this build does not model, so
// the loop would not repeat even if the trigger fired. What IS this ticket's
// behaviour is the RememberLoser$ binding itself: a LOST flip must bind the
// flipper as Remembered (and a won flip must leave Remembered untouched),
// which is exactly what the real card's repeat gate goes on to count. The
// chained DB$ DealDamage | Defined$ Remembered makes that binding observable
// as life loss on the loser and no life loss on the winner.

// TestFlipCoinRememberLoserBindsTheLosingFlipper is the behavioural test for

// sacrifice-then-flip chain on the real engine and asserts BOTH branches: a
// lost flip remembers the flipper, so the chained Defined$ Remembered reader
// takes 3 off that player's life; a won flip remembers nobody, so no life
// moves. With the RememberLoser$ assignment removed, the loss branch also
// remembers nobody and the lost-flip seed loses no life -- which is what the
// "no unread note" coverage alone could not see.
