// counterAddedMatches implements the "when a counter is put on" trigger

// tenth +1/+1 counter is put on NICKNAME") and Mode$ CounterAddedOnce (Simic
// Ascendancy's "Whenever one or more +1/+1 counters are put on a creature you
// control"). The two modes share this matcher because the engine emits ONE
// CounterChange event per placement batch, with the whole batch in Amount:
// "one trigger per counter-placing event, not per counter" is exactly the
// CounterAddedOnce contract, and the modes differ only in that
// CounterAddedOnce never carries CounterAmount$ (measured: 0 corpus lines)
// while its bodies read TriggerCount$Amount instead. The gate is the
// CounterChange
// event that put counters (Amount > 0: a removal event never adds one).
// CounterType$ names the kind. CounterAmount$ <op><n> is the crossing gate
// the card text means: the trigger fires when the put takes the event's
// counter kind's total on the object from below n to at least n -- the tenth
// counter is put whether one event put 10 or a 5-then-5 pair crossed, and a
// batch that overshoots (9+2) also crossed it. A put that does not cross
// (7+1, 11+1) fires nothing. The threshold ops (EQ/GT/GE) all read as that
// one crossing -- the corpus's CounterAdded CounterAmount$ values are EQ only
// (EQ3..EQ12, every one an oracle "when the <Nth> counter is put" gate), so
// EQ is the measured shape and GT/GE collapse onto it unmeasured. An absent
// CounterAmount$ is Forge's plain "whenever a counter is put" -- every put

// counterRemovedMatches is CounterAdded's mirror for Mode$ CounterRemoved AND

// (effects/counters.go's removal primitives, rules/turn.go:64's suspend TIME
// upkeep decrement), filtered by CounterType$ (case-insensitive, same as the
// Added arm), ValidCard$/ValidPlayer$ and TriggerZones$ (the shared zoneGate
// already ran). CounterChange carries no player field, so ValidPlayer$ is
// matched against the object's controller -- the convention counterAddedMatches
// uses. NewCounterAmount$ is Forge's "the LAST counter" gate: the post-event
// total for the counter kind must equal the named value -- events.Apply folds
// the removal before checkTriggers runs, so o.Counter(ev.Counter) is already
// the total after. A malformed value fails closed (the Added arm's
// strconv/splitCompare style). Fire-once semantics are the event granularity:
// one Amount: -N batch removal is ONE trigger, exactly as CounterAdded fires
// once per CounterChange, and that IS the CounterRemovedOnce contract --
// "one or more counters removed" is one CounterChange, never one trigger per
// counter. The two modes differ only in that a CounterRemovedOnce body reads
// the removed magnitude through TriggerCount$Amount (Chandra, Fire Artisan's
// "deals that much damage"; B.O.B. Bevy of Beebles; Regenerations Restored),
// which the referent capture in trigger_referents.go supplies. No corpus
// CounterRemovedOnce line carries CounterAmount$/NewCounterAmount$.

// counterPlayerAddedAllMatches implements Mode$ CounterPlayerAddedAll --
// "Whenever you put one or more counters on a(n) <spec>" (Generous Patron,
// Rikku Resourceful Guardian, Kros Defense Contractor): the batch trigger
// that follows the PLAYER putting the counters, not (only) the recipient.
// It fires on BOTH placement events: CounterChange (an object gained
// counters) and PlayerCounterChange (a player gained counters -- The Great
// Goblin's "a permanent or player", All Will Be One's same shape), with
// Amount > 0 (a removal never adds one). The trigger-level params (PlayerTurn$,
// ActivationLimit$, the intervening-if) run through the shared gates like
// every other event mode.
//
// Batch granularity is the EVENT, never the counter: the engine emits one
// placement event per recipient object with the whole batch in Amount, and
// one matching event queues exactly one trigger however many counters that
// one batch carried -- the "one or more" reading, the same
// batch-of-one-per-event granularity the ChangesZoneAll registration shares
// (rules/trigmatch_zone.go). One activation hitting several recipients
// emits one event per recipient and queues one trigger per MATCHING
// recipient event (each named by its own text); a batch that lands N
// counters on ONE object queues one trigger, not N.
//
// ValidObject$ names the counter RECIPIENT as comma alternatives, object
// and player forms mixed (All Will Be One's
// "Permanent.inRealZoneBattlefield,Player"; the player form is
// matched with MatchesPlayerSpec, the object form with MatchesSpecFrom,
// each alternative by its own form -- a creature spec never matches a
// player recipient and vice versa). A line with no ValidObject$ admits both
// forms. ValidCard$/ValidPlayer$ keep the generic trigger read through
// eventCardAndPlayerMatch for scripts that spell the recipient that way
// (no corpus line of this mode does; measured at the ticket pin).
//
// ValidSource$ names the player CAUSING the placement (Generous Patron's
// ValidSource$ You): a role the CounterChange event does not carry (it
// records the recipient only), read from the engine's in-flight adder
// scratch -- inFlightCounterAdder, the same read the AddCounter
// replacement's ValidSource$ line uses (a published cost/turn-site
// override wins, else the resolving ability's controller, else the line
// fails closed rather than matching every placement).
//
// ValidObjectToSource$ (Bold Plagiarist) is NOT implemented: the
// recipient spec whose You anchors to the counter-putter, with no second
// carrier to pin the reading against -- a trigger carrying it fails closed
// (never fires) rather than matching with a guessed anchor. Measured, the
// only corpus carrier is bold_plagiarist (Aragorn, Company Leader, whose
// earlier census note named it here, in fact uses ValidObject$
// Card.Self+inRealZoneBattlefield).
