// The PlayerCount<group>$Condition<OP><RHS> <property> family and its
// companions (PlayerCountHasLost$Amount, the relative-player StartingLife
// property). Every fixture drives the REAL compiled corpus card. The brief's
// three carriers are the observable surface:
//
//   - Smuggler's Share: `PlayerCountOpponents$ConditionGE2 CardsDrawn` (the
//     draw leg) and `...ConditionGE2 ThisTurnEntered_Battlefield_Land.YouCtrl`
//     (the Treasure leg).
//   - Anya, Merciless Angel: `PlayerCountOpponents$ConditionLTZ LifeTotal`
//     with `Z = PlayerCountDefinedPlayer.PlayerUID_RelativePlayerUID$StartingLife/HalfDown`,
//     behind both her +3/+3-per-opponent static and her Indestructible static.
//   - Hot Pursuit: `CheckSVar$ PlayerCountHasLost$Amount | SVarCompare$ GE2`,
//     the intervening-if on its begin-combat gain-control trigger.
//
// The brief claimed Hot Pursuit and Anya failed OPEN (wrong-wide). Both
// gate paths fail CLOSED on an unresolvable count head
// (rules/trigger_condition.go's `!evaluated || !holds` and
// rules/statics.go's `!evaluated` branch), so the pre-fix behaviour was
// wrong-DEAD, not wrong-wide; these tests pin the post-fix CORRECT firing
// (fires exactly at the threshold), which is the defect the brief named.
