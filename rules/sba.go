// checkStateBased, checkGameOver and destroyLethalDamage all predate this
// file: Task 21 added destroyLethalDamage (combat depends on lethal-damage
// and zero-toughness destruction, and nothing in this codebase checked
// either before then), and stubs.go carried checkStateBased/checkGameOver
// as a placeholder ever since Task 3 -- a checkGameOver call and nothing
// else. This task deletes stubs.go outright and relocates all three here
// rather than losing them with it, and fills in the state-based actions M1
// actually specifies: a player at 0 or less life loses (CR 704.5a); an
// eliminated player's permanents leave the battlefield; the game ends in a
// win when exactly one seat remains and a draw (CR 104.4a) when none do --
// not, as stubs.go's own checkGameOver used to, an unconditional win for
// seat 0 when nobody survived. Drawing from an empty library (CR 704.5c) is
// already a loss as of Task 14 (effects.DrawFor emits PlayerLost directly at
// the moment of the failed draw, which checkStateBased's own permanent-
// removal pass below picks up on its next run regardless of how a player
// came to be Lost); this build has no poison-counter mechanic, so CR
// 704.5b's poison loss is checked with life and commander damage below.

// rearm forgets every memory when the alive-player set has shrunk since it

// this is called at each of the points that consult the memories, not once
// per pass, because the sweep loop, destroyLethalDamage and ceaseDeadTokens
// all run AFTER the pass's own eliminations are marked and must not be
// re-armed out from under an attempt they made under the very same alive
// set.
//
// Player.Lost is monotone (events/apply.go's PlayerLost case is its only
// non-test writer and only ever sets it true), so alive never grows and
// this can fire at most len(Players) times per checkStateBased call: the
// loop stays bounded by work, not just by maxSBAPasses.
//
// Ruling T22-q (fix round 5, comment only -- no behaviour changed): this
// key closes ONE of the two ways a blocker can go inert mid-call, and the
// round-4 wording of this comment claimed both. It does not. Read it as a
// partial fix with a known open half, because that is what it is.
//
//   - CLOSED, the elimination sub-case: applyReplacements discovers
//     replacements through forEachObject, which walks AliveFrom(0), so
//     every replacement an eliminated player owns stops being consulted the
//     instant they are marked Lost. That is what alive tracks, and the
//     reason a blocked attempt is worth exactly one retry when it changes.
//
//   - OPEN, the predicate-flip sub-case (N9, booked for the whole-branch
//     review rather than patched here): a replacement also goes inert by
//     ceasing to MATCH. replacementMatches evaluates ValidCard$ through
//     effects.MatchesSpecFrom against the MOVING object, reading its Tapped
//     flag, its P1P1 counters, its zone, its controller and its combat
//     flags -- and every one of those is writable by a registered
//     ReplaceWith$ primitive (effects' Tap, PutCounter, RemoveCounterAll).
//     "The predicate is matched against the moving object" is therefore not
//     a safety property, which is how round 4 read it; it is precisely what
//     lets the substitute effect that blocked an attempt flip the predicate
//     that blocked it. Measured by a probe re-implementing
//     replacementMatches from outside the package: 0 outstanding-SBA
//     decision points at 29fa00d, 6 at bd3c730 and 4 here, out of ~2 261 --
//     0.18%, self-healing on the next checkStateBased call, and never
//     touching the CR 704.5a life invariant.
//
// What a future author most needs from this comment: widening the key --
// which is what a zone gate on replacements, or a ValidCard$ predicate a
// static effect can flip, would force -- must NOT be done by re-arming on
// "some other state-based action actually succeeded", nor on any signal a
// removal produces. A death chain then buys one re-arm per link, and the
// blocked removal sweep goes from a flat 2 firings per Submit back to
// 2/3/7/22/61 for chain lengths 0/1/5/20/60 -- 29fa00d's pre-round-3
// amplification. That variant has now been built and measured twice, once
// in fix round 4 and once independently by the re-review, agreeing to the
// digit. TestRemovalSweepFiringsDoNotScaleWithAnUnrelatedDeathChain is the
// assertion that catches it being made again.
//
// One more thing this file has repeatedly got wrong in prose: the residue
// above is NOT bounded by maxSBAPasses and is NOT announced by the Note
// below. A replacement that blocks an attempt forever does not exhaust the
// budget at all -- the attempted sets make the pass report no new work, the
// loop goes stable, and it returns silently. That is correct behaviour (a
// permanent block is a legitimate rules-level fixed point; there is nothing
// to warn about), and it is measured: zero Note events over five Submits
// for both the blocked destruction and the blocked removal sweep. The Note
// covers the OTHER case, an unbounded cycle of genuinely new work, and has
// never seen this one.

// checkStateBased applies state-based actions until none apply, which is
// what CR 704.3 requires: they are checked and rechecked, not just once.
// TestSBALoopsUntilStable is the regression test for the "not just once"
// half -- a lord dying can make a creature its own static was keeping alive
// newly lethal, and that second creature must not survive to see a second,
// separate checkStateBased call before it is caught.
//
// Ruling T22-h (fix round 1): "changed" must come from checkLoseConditions
// and destroyLethalDamage observing actual state after they emit, never
// from the fact that they emitted something. Engine.emit runs replacement
// effects first (rules/trigger.go), and a matching replacement can discard
// the very MoveZone this file proposes entirely -- a permanent this pass
// thinks it destroyed can simply still be sitting on the battlefield once
// the emit returns. The previous version of both functions reported
// "changed" from the event it built, not from where the object ended up,
// so a replacement that keeps a lethally-damaged permanent in play (a
// regeneration shield, "sacrifice a Clue instead", or the reviewer's own
// gain-1-life-instead reproduction) made every single pass "find" the same
// permanent lethal again: not a one-time miscount but the full
// maxSBAPasses budget, spent and reported as "changed", on every
// checkStateBased call for the rest of the match. See checkLoseConditions'
// removal sweep below for where that half of the fix lives; if
// maxSBAPasses is nonetheless exhausted (a genuine cycle, not a
// replacement -- e.g. a static that keeps making a different creature
// lethal forever), a Note event says so rather than the game quietly
// carrying on with state-based actions still outstanding.
//
// Ruling T22-j (fix round 2): destroyLethalDamage's own half of T22-h can
// UNDER-report. Reading "did it actually leave" is right for whether THAT
// object needs re-examining, but it threw away the fact that an attempt
// happened at all -- and checkLoseConditions runs before destroyLethalDamage
// within one pass, so a replacement whose substitute effect changes
// SBA-relevant state elsewhere (the reviewer's reproduction: `ReplaceWith$`
// a life-loss instead of a move) only becomes visible to checkLoseConditions
// on a LATER pass. Reporting "the shield didn't move, so nothing changed"
// denied the loop that later pass, so a player it drove to 0 life could sit
// there, un-Lost, handed a decision. attempted (below) is the fix: a set of
// object IDs destroyLethalDamage has already tried this call, threaded
// through every pass of this loop rather than rebuilt per pass, so an
// object already attempted is skipped on later passes (preserving T22-h's
// bound: one attempt per object per checkStateBased call, not thirty-two),
// while "changed" now means "attempted something NEW this pass" -- which is
// true on pass 1 regardless of outcome, giving pass 2 the chance to see
// whatever the replacement's own effect changed.
//
// Ruling T22-n (fix round 3): checkLoseConditions' own removal sweep had
// the identical shape T22-j fixed, one loop over -- "changed" came from
// whether a player's battlefield zone actually shrank, so a replacement
// that blocks the exile but changes SBA-relevant state elsewhere (some
// other player's life total) was invisible to this sweep and denied the
// later pass that would have caught it, same as T22-j's shield. swept
// (below) is destroyLethalDamage's attempted, one loop over: a set of
// PlayerIDs already swept this call, so "changed" means "swept someone new
// this pass" rather than "someone's battlefield actually shrank" -- the
// same discipline, applied to the same function's second loop, so the two
// no longer disagree about what "changed" means.
//
// Ruling T22-p (fix round 4): the discipline T22-j and T22-n share can
// under-COMPLETE, which is the mirror image of the under-report T22-j
// fixed. Whether an attempt succeeds is decided by the replacement effects
// that apply to it, and applyReplacements only ever looks at objects
// controlled by a player who is still alive (trigger.go's forEachObject
// walks AliveFrom(0)) -- so a blocker stops blocking the instant its
// controller is eliminated, and the blocked attempt's own substitute
// effect is routinely what eliminates them: a creature with lethal damage
// whose destruction a Creature.Other guardian replaces with "the
// guardian's controller loses 1 life", with that controller one life from
// zero. The attempt that failed under the old alive set would succeed
// under the new one, but the object was already in objs, so nothing
// retried it and the decision went out with a state-based action
// outstanding and nothing left on the board able to prevent it.
//
// tried.rearm is the fix, and the alive-player count is deliberately the
// ONLY thing that re-arms. It is the input that decides whether a
// replacement is consulted at all, and it is monotone, so both sets are
// cleared at most len(Players) times per call. It is NOT the only way a
// blocker can go stale -- a replacement that stops matching goes inert just
// as thoroughly as one whose controller died, and that half is still open;
// see Ruling T22-q on rearm above before widening this key. Re-arming on the
// wider "some other state-based action actually succeeded" instead would
// re-arm a blocked attempt once per link of an entirely unrelated death
// chain, which is the per-pass amplification T22-h exists to prevent. Built
// and measured rather than assumed: on
// TestRemovalSweepFiringsDoNotScaleWithAnUnrelatedDeathChain's own board,
// re-arming whenever the battlefield population actually shrank takes the
// blocked sweep from a flat 2 firings per Submit back to 2/3/7/22/61 for
// chain lengths 0/1/5/20/60 -- 29fa00d's pre-round-3 figures exactly. A
// repeatedly-blocked attempt with nobody dying is therefore still tried
// exactly once per checkStateBased call, as T22-h requires.
