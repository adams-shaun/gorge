// Task m33: commander damage, and the 21-damage state-based action (CR
// 903.10). Combat damage dealt to a player by a commander is tallied
// per-commander (state.Player.CmdDamage, keyed by the match-wide dense
// commander index m30's genesis assigns); a player with 21 or more from the
// same commander loses, as a state-based action like the life-loss check.
//
// The four traps CR 903.10 trips on, each pinned by a named test below:
//   - COMBAT damage only (a ping / burn / triggered damage never tallies);
//   - cumulative over the WHOLE game, across death and recast (the tally is
//     keyed by the commander's stable ObjID, so a recast keeps the slot);
//   - damage dealt to a PLAYER, never to a permanent (only the toPlayer
//     combat branch ever emits the CmdDamage event);
//   - a state-based action that loses the game like any other loss (sba.go
//     emits the same PlayerLost checkLoseConditions already uses).
//
// Everything is gated on Config.Format == FormatCommander: a Constructed-
// format game, even one carrying a Commanders config, is untouched.
