// The generic ValidTgts$ pre-ask (task mvts1, the "tgts" resume arm) is
// CONSUMED by chosenTargetsFor before the body runs, and every resume builds
// a fresh Ctx. So when the body then suspends on an ask of its own, the next
// resume re-enters the SA from its top with no answer and re-poses the
// pre-ask -- and the two asks alternate forever.
//
// That livelock was fixed once, for MoveCounter alone, by the per-object
// moveCounterAsk cursor (the movecounter1 fix). It is a defect of the SHARED
// pre-ask, not of MoveCounter, and the live corpus carrier is Kozilek's
// Command: its CharmNum$ 2 election can pick `DBScry` (`DB$ Scry | ScryNum$ X
// | ValidTgts$ Player`) alongside another targeting mode, so the stack
// object's one undivided target list is not DBScry's player, the pre-ask
// fires at resolution, and the Scry's own KArrange is the second ask -- which
// loops arrange -> tgts -> arrange until the livelock watcher panics.
//
// The carrier below is a SYNTHETIC script of the same shape (never a .cards
// file -- the licensing rule), reduced to the minimum that reproduces it: a
// trigger whose Execute$ root carries no ValidTgts$ (so the CR 603.3c
// placement ask covers nothing) and whose depth-1 SubAbility$ is a
// ValidTgts$-bearing Scry (so the pre-ask fires there, and the Scry then
// suspends on its KArrange). Kozilek's Command reaches the identical pair
// through its Charm election; this fixture reaches it without needing an
// announced X, a two-mode election or a 19-card library.
