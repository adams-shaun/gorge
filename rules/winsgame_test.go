// Tests for api:WinsGame (task api-winsgame) and the Count$MostCardName head
// its pinned real carrier needs. Mechanized Production is the end-to-end pin:
// its upkeep trigger copies the enchanted artifact, then wins the game if the
// controller has eight or more artifacts sharing a name -- the count comes
// from `SVar:X:Count$MostCardName Artifact.YouCtrl`, the win from
// `DB$ WinsGame | Defined$ You | ConditionCheckSVar$ X | ConditionSVarCompare$
// GE8`. The test places the real corpus card plus eight same-named artifact
// permanents under seat 0, fires the upkeep trigger, and asserts the game ends
// with seat 0 as the winner (events.GameOver's Amount-0 win shape).
//
// The helper tests pin the two halves in isolation so a regression names the
// broken half directly: Count$MostCardName's greatest-same-name count, and
// WinsGame's GameOver emission.
