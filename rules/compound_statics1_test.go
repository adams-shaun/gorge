// compound-statics1: the compound `S:Mode$ CantAttack,CantBlock` split landed
// as commit f81f996e (cards/parse.go splitStaticModes), so each mode reaches
// the runtime as its OWN static sharing one Params map. That made a
// condition-bearing compound line reachable to attackBlocked: Bast, Panther
// Goddess prints
//
//	S:Mode$ CantAttack,CantBlock | ValidCard$ Card.Self |
//	    IsPresent$ Creature.YouCtrl | PresentCompare$ LE2
//
// The block half already bound at runtime (blockRestricted's CantBlock loop
// runs continuousGateHolds with no whitelist); the attack half was skipped
// WHOLE because CantAttackParamsReadableForRules (effects/misc.go) never
// admitted IsPresent$/IsPresent2$/PresentCompare$. This test is the
// end-to-end pin on the real corpus card: both halves restrict at two
// creatures and release at three.
//
// Every fixture mutation goes through e.emit, so the test ends replay-verified.
