// mulliganRound is the London mulligan round's plain-value state, built by
// New between the opening deal and turn 1 and driven one decision at a time
// by stepPregame (rules/turn.go's step dispatches here while e.pregame). It
// is plain data, never a closure, so a clone copies it like cast/choosing.
//
// seats is the round order -- e.G.AliveFrom(startingPlayer) at New time, a
// slice, deterministic: CR 103.5 has the STARTING PLAYER declare first and
// each other player follow in turn order, so the round starts at the toss
// winner, not at seat 0 (kept[i], taken[i] and seats[i] correspond by
// position). limit is Config.Mulligans, which is the PERMITTED
// COUNT -- the most mulligans one seat may take (Ruling FL-113, rule R-8.4).
// It is NOT the CR 103.5b multiplayer free mulligan, which is derived from the
// seat count and exempts a seat from the bottoming PENALTY, never from the
// allowance; an earlier version of this comment called limit "the
// free-mulligan count" and that wording was wrong. freeMulligans is fixed from
// the round's initial seat count. bottom is false during the keep/mulligan
// phase and true during the bottoming phase; cursor names the next seat to ask
