// The trigger-mode dispatch used to be one switch in trigger_match.go, which
// made every ticket touching a mode edit the same file. It is now a table the
// per-mode trigmatch_*.go files register into. These tests pin the two
// properties that replace what the compiler used to give us for free: no mode
// silently loses its matcher, and no two files claim the same mode.

// registeredModes is every Mode$ the switch dispatched before the split. A mode
// dropping out of the table is a mode that silently stops firing, which no
// other test would catch -- the trigger just never matches.

	"Discover", "SeekAll",
	// rolled-die-trigger: "Whenever you roll a die ..." (CR 706; Mr. House,

	"RolledDie", "RolledDieOnce",
	// connive1: "Whenever a creature you control connives ..." (CR 702.59;

	"Connives",
	// enlist1: "Whenever CARDNAME enlists a creature ..." (CR 702.160;
	// Goblin Morale Sergeant, Guardian of New Benalia). It matches the

	// exploit1: "Whenever a creature exploits a creature ..." (CR 702.58c;

	// could not have been in the pre-split switch.
	"Exploited",
	// manaexpend1: "Whenever you expend N ..." (the Bloomburrow Commander
	// expend keyword: Teapot Slinger, Trailtracker Scout, Wandertale Mentor,
	// Pyreswipe Hawk and 8 more corpus carriers). It matches rules/cast.go's

	// dispatched it.
	// phaseoutall1: "Whenever one or more other permanents phase out" (CR

	// trig-damageall: "Whenever one or more <sources> deal damage to one or
	// more <targets>" (Contaminant Grafter, Malcolm Keen-Eyed Navigator,

	// Damage event the pre-split switch already carried for DamageDone -- the
	// response is one batch-level instance per damage batch (rules/
	// trigger_match.go's all-latch), but the MODE name is new, so no pre-split
	// switch arm could have dispatched it.
	"DamageAll",

	// 5 corpus Mode$ BecomeMonarch carriers: Knights of the Black Rose,

	"BecomeMonarch",
	// counterchange-triggers: "Whenever one or more counters are removed from
	// CARDNAME" (Regenerations Restored, Chandra Fire Artisan, B.O.B. Bevy of

	// batch, which is the Once contract (matcher: counterRemovedMatches).
	"CounterRemovedOnce",
	// counterplayeraddedall: "Whenever you put one or more counters on a(n)
	// <spec>" (Generous Patron, Rikku Resourceful Guardian, Kros Defense

	// Polukranos and the mode's 19 corpus carrier files). It matches the
	// events.AlterAttribute mark events.Apply folds for the Monstrosity$
	// param's Text "Monstrous" mark -- the event Kind existed already, but
	// the MODE did not -- so no pre-split switch arm could have dispatched it.

	// trig-surveil: "Whenever you surveil ..." (CR 701.42; Mirko, Obsessive
	// Theorist; Dimir Spybug; Thoughtbound Phantasm; Whispering Snitch and 8

	// switch.
	"Surveil",
	// agent-20260919T183016Z-886b1a86: "Whenever you give a gift ..."
	// (CR 702.168; Jolly Gerbils, the one corpus carrier). It matches the
	// events.GiveGift marker Kind, which was appended for it alongside the
	// GiftPromise election record, so it could not have been in the pre-split
	// switch -- no prior engine action produced a gift-completion event.
	"GiveGift",
	// agent-20260920T063816Z-abb68c8f: "Whenever CARDNAME becomes unattached
	// from a permanent ..." (CR 701.3b; Captain's Hook, Grafted Exoskeleton,
	// Grafted Wargear, Stitcher's Graft). It matches the events.Unattached
	// marker Kind, which was appended for it so that a detach fires this mode
	// while Mode$ Attached keeps ignoring it -- the detach SBAs previously
	// logged an empty-IDs events.Attach, so no pre-split switch arm could
	// have dispatched it.
	"Unattached",
	// trig-searched-library: a completed search marker was added because
	// ordinary library card moves cannot identify a search to the trigger.
	// The marker Kind is new, so the pre-split switch could not dispatch it.

	// Printlifter Ooze, Woolly Loxodon and the mode's 125 corpus carriers).

	// Mode$ TurnFaceUp arm emits it), so no pre-split switch arm could have
	// dispatched it.
	"TurnFaceUp",

	// infesting_radroach on Mode$ Milled, the_wise_mothman, mirelurk_queen
	// and screeching_scorchbeast on Mode$ MilledAll). They match the mill
	// MoveZone marker events.Mill emits -- the action marker effMill gained
	// with the mode, the IsDiscard/IsSacrifice discipline -- so no pre-split
	// switch arm existed for either name and no library->graveyard move
	// could be told from a mill without the marker.
	"Milled", "MilledAll",

	// Intentions' SVar body at the pin -- Veronica Dissident Scribe, Magmakin
	// Artillerist, Marauding Mako, Rielle the Everwise and the rest). It
	// matches the ordinary discard MoveZone event the pre-split switch already
	// carried for Discarded -- the response is one batch-level instance per
	// discard action (rules/trigger_match.go's discard latch) -- but the MODE
	// name is new, so no pre-split switch arm could have dispatched it.
	"DiscardedAll",
	// task scrybottom: "Whenever you choose to put one or more cards on the

	// Anchor, the corpus's one `ToBottom$ True` carrier at the pin -- 20
	// files carry `T:Mode$ Scry`). It matches the events.Scry marker Kind
	// appended for it, which rules' handleArrange emits only once the
	// KArrange answer is known (the count actually put on the bottom), so
	// no pre-split switch arm could have dispatched it.
	"Scry",

	// (CR 702.99b; Watchful Radstag, Renegade Krasis -- the 2 corpus
	// carriers). It matches the events.Evolved marker Kind, which was
	// appended for it (resolveTop emits it once the Evolve keyword ability's
	// counter actually lands), so no pre-split switch arm could have
	// dispatched it -- evolve previously announced only its own counter
	// trigger and no separate mode existed.
	"Evolved",
	// trig:FullyUnlock (task agent-20260919T191104Z-95f1e316): CR 709.5's
	// "Eerie -- whenever ... you fully unlock a Room" (17 corpus carriers,
	// the Eerie enchantments e.g. Fear of Sleep Paralysis). It matches the
	// pre-existing events.DoorUnlock transition, but the MODE did not exist:
	// the pre-split switch dispatched the unlock door's own Mode$ UnlockDoor
	// through a dedicated face scan (rules/rooms.go), never a Mode$
	// FullyUnlock that lives on an unrelated battlefield permanent, so no
	// pre-split switch arm could have dispatched it.
	"FullyUnlock",
	// trig-proliferate: "Whenever you proliferate ..." (CR 701.27; the 6
	// corpus carrier files at the pin -- Voidwing Hybrid, Ezuri Stalker of
	// Spheres, Scheming Aspirant, Venser Corpse Puppet, Ichor Aberration,
	// Contagion Dispenser). It matches the events.Proliferate marker Kind,
	// which was appended for it because a CounterChange cannot be the signal
	// (a proliferate with no eligible recipient still happened, while an
	// ordinary counter addition is not a proliferate action), so it could not
	// have been in the pre-split switch.
	"Proliferate",

	// carrier at the pin -- measured
	// `/usr/bin/grep -rlE 'T:Mode\$ Foretell' .cards/cardsfolder | wc -l`
	// => 1). It matches the {2} Foretell special action's pay-time
	// FlagForetold CastInfo (rules/cast.go's foretell branch, card still in
	// hand) and the effect-designation exile MoveZone markers
	// (applyFaceDownMarker's Foretold$ True composition), both of which
