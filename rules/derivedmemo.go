// Derived memo for one legal-actions walk.
//
// legalActionsPriced (the priority offer walk and its potential-action twin)
// asks Derived for the same objects over and over: every cost/restriction
// static's ValidCard$ match goes through matchesSpec, which reads the
// candidate's derived keywords, and HasKeyword, derivedKeywordParam and the
// granted-cycling/cumulative/mana-ability collectors each derive the same
// object again. Measured on botbench -pairs all -games 4 -seed 13 (27 decks),
// 39.3M of the 68.9M derivedWith calls ran inside a legal-actions walk and
// 29.7M of those (75.5%) repeated an object already derived earlier in the
// SAME walk; outside the walk the repeat rate is ~11%, so the memo is scoped
// to the walk and nowhere else.
//
// Why the walk scope and not a global per-epoch cache: Derived's inputs are
// the board (e.G, moved only by events.Apply, so len(e.L.Events) keys it),
// e.continuous (keyed by continuousVersion, exactly active()'s cache key), and
// a set of NON-event engine runtime fields that the layer walk reads
// transitively -- the rename table and its renameBuilding guard, the layer-4
// type table and typesBuilding, the effectMatchOverride observer binding,
// goadProbe, derivingColors*, activeDepth/derivedDepth, and whatever an
// EvalCount host method reads for a layer-7 amount. A global cache would have
// to prove every one of those constant across an epoch (and tests mutate
// e.G directly with no event at all). legalActionsPriced is documented and
// written as a pure read -- it emits no event and writes no state field -- so
// inside one walk every one of those inputs is fixed, and the memo only has to
// be invalidated by the walk's own boundaries:
//
//   - derivedMemoGen is bumped on every OUTERMOST scope entry, so an entry
//     built by an earlier walk is never served (whatever changed between the
//     two walks, event-backed or not, is irrelevant);
//   - each entry also records (len(e.L.Events), continuousVersion,
//     len(e.G.Objs)) and must match all three, so even an emit or a
//     continuous-registry write inside a walk (none exists today) would miss
//     rather than serve a stale result;
//   - derivedMemoUsable bypasses the memo (neither read nor written) whenever
//     one of the runtime guards above is live, i.e. for any Derived that is
//     nested inside another derivation, an active() build, a rename/type
//     table build, a goad probe or an Effect observer match. The atStack
//     zone-override path (convoke's AffectedZone$ Stack read) is memoized
//     in its own table (derivedMemoStack), keyed and guarded identically.
//
// Ownership: a cached result's Keywords/Types are copied out of the shared
// derivedKW/derivedTypes scratch into the entry's own backing arrays, so a
// later Derived of ANOTHER object (which rewrites the scratch) can never
// mutate a slice a caller is still ranging. An entry's arrays are rewritten
// only when the same ObjID misses again, which within one walk cannot happen
// (the key cannot move), and callers never retain a Derived result past the
// walk (Derived's documented contract). The arrays are reused across walks,
// so the steady state stays allocation-free.
//
// derivedMemoVerify (set by the rules test binary, or at link time through
// derivedMemoVerifyFlag for a botbench run) recomputes every hit and panics
// on any difference -- the empirical half of the argument above.

// Carrying the priority walk across the decision boundary.
//
// A bot seat answers a priority decision by building its board
// (botpolicy.BoardFromGameInto), which derives every battlefield creature and
// every card in the seat's own zones -- the objects askPriority's offer walk
// derived a moment earlier, at the same board. BeginDerivedReads /
// EndDerivedReads open a memo scope for such an external pure read, and when
// the engine is provably still at the state that walk read, the scope RESUMES
// the walk's generation instead of starting a new one, so those Derived
// results are served rather than recomputed. The resume condition
// (derivedMemoTailLive) is:
//
//   - askPriority recorded the tail right after its walk and before its ask,
//     and the decision it posed is still e.pending -- pointer identity, so no
//     Submit has run since (Submit clears pending before anything else) and
//     no other ask replaced it;
//   - derivedMemoGen is still the walk's, so no other scope opened since;
//   - continuousVersion and len(e.G.Objs) are unchanged;
//   - every event logged since the walk is a DecisionAsk marker (ask's own
//     emit), whose Apply writes nothing.
//
// Between that walk and the ask, askPriority runs no code, and ask's emit of
// the marker is the only engine work; the non-event runtime inputs the walk
// contract lists (rename/type tables, observer bindings, goad probes, depth
// counters) are all at rest outside a derivation, as they were when the walk
// read them. The walk's entries were keyed at the walk's log length, which
// the marker has since grown, so the resumed scope aliases exactly that pair:
// an entry keyed at the walk's length is valid while the log is at the
// scope's opening length (derivedMemoAliasFrom/To), and any further emit
// still misses. Anything else -- a non-priority decision, a Submit, a
// direct test write to e.G without an event -- opens a fresh generation
// exactly as a walk does (a direct write between an ask and a board build is
// the one input the argument cannot see; verify mode below, which recomputes
// every hit, is what checks the suite never does that).
//
// Submit refuses to run inside a BeginDerivedReads scope: the scope promises
// a pure read.
