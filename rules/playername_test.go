// TestPlayerNamesDoNotReachTheChain is the F3 invariant that guards B3's
// name/deck split at the engine layer: a per-seat PlayerName is a display
// name (view.PlayerView.Name, protocol.SeatInfo.Name) and must never reach
// event text, because the event log is the replay-hashed chain. Two engines
// built from one Config differing ONLY in PlayerNames must produce identical
// chain heads at every step, including after a full game is driven to Over.
//
// The engine still puts the deck identity (Config.Names) in event text, so
// routing a PlayerName into a MatchDraw or a trigger's description would move
// a chain head — exactly the regression this test exists to catch. It builds
// its own engines (two seats, decks just big enough to deck out in a handful
// of turns) and never touches rules/heads_test.go or acceptanceHeads.
