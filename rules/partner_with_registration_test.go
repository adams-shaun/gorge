// TestPartnerWithPrimitiveIsRegistered pins the registration of
// "kw:Partner with" (CR 903.13c, the named-pair alias of kw:Partner) in the
// trigger_match.go non-API supported list. The deck-construction half is not
// play: rules/engine.go's partnerPairOK -> deck.IsPartnerPair seats the mutual
// named pair, so the registration asserts the corpus shape is understood and
// the census stops counting the carriers unplayable. The keyword's OTHER half
// -- CR 702.128's ETB may-search -- is real rules text and is implemented by
// the cards/kw_partner_with.go expansion, pinned end to end by the proof leaf
// in rules/partner_with_etb_test.go. The walk below is over the compiled
// corpus, never a hardcoded count: every K:Partner with carrier must no longer
// name the keyword as a gap, and any carrier still unplayable must be blocked
// on a DIFFERENT, known primitive
// (the measured six: Madame Vastra/Gorm the Great must-block, Pir
// api:ReplaceCounter/repl:AddCounter, Rory api:Investigate, Amy Pond
// api:RemoveCounter/kw:Doctor's companion, Jenny Flint kw:Training).
