// Layer-inert cache reuse.
//
// active()'s sorted effect list, the staticEffects memo under it and the
// layer-4 derived-type table (refreshDerivedTypes) were each keyed on the log
// head, so every emitted event rebuilt them -- the whole staticEffects scan
// over every object's statics, once per event. But ~70% of a game's events
// are priority bookkeeping that cannot move any of their inputs:
//
//   - DecisionAsk and DecisionMade are pure markers: events.Apply writes
//     nothing for them.
//   - Priority writes only g.Priority and g.Passes, which nothing on the layer
//     path reads (only the priority-flow code in turn.go/legal.go does).
//
// None of the three is read back out of the log by a layer-path census
// either (the log scans on that path look for PutOnStack, TurnChange,
// CounterChange, Damage and the like). So when every event appended since a
// cache was built is one of them, AND continuousVersion and len(e.G.Objs) are
// unchanged since the build (the two non-log inputs the caches can see move
// without an event: a registry write and a test helper's direct AddObject),
// the cached value is exactly what a rebuild would produce, and the cache is
// re-stamped with the new log head instead. A rebuild still happens on every
// other event, exactly as before, so the reuse only ever removes rebuilds
// whose result would have been identical -- the chain, replay and every
// output are unchanged.
//
// An epoch <= 0 (a fresh engine, a clone, or cascade.go's explicit -1
// invalidation around its scratch-driven walk) never reuses.
//
// layerInertVerify (set by the rules test binary, or at link time through
// layerInertVerifyFlag) recomputes on every reuse and panics on a difference,
// so the whole rules suite checks that argument empirically.
// go build -ldflags "-X github.com/adams-shaun/gorge/rules.layerInertVerifyFlag=1".
