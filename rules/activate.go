// activate.go is the activated-ability flow. legal.go offers every legal
// non-mana AB$ ability as an "ability" priority option (rules/legal.go),
// priced by its own Cost$ through the same castable gate every "cast" option
// uses so nothing unpayable is ever offered (totality). Choosing one reaches
// beginActivation here, which reuses the cast flow (cast.go's pendingCast /
// continueCast / commitCast) -- an activated ability with an {X}, Sac, or
// Discard part asks and pays those the same way a spell does, and commitCast's
// ability branch pays the tap / SubCounter parts and pushes the ability onto
// the stack via AbilityPush, then asks targets if the ability declares any.

// beginActivation starts the activation flow for opt (an "ability" priority
// option): parse the ability's own Cost$ into a pendingCast and run the same
// stages a cast runs (X, Delve -- an ability never has Delve, so that stage
// is a no-op --, Sac, Discard), then commitCast pays everything and pushes the
// ability. A stale option (the permanent left its zone, or opt.Ability no
// longer indexes the face) degrades to a no-op rather than panicking the one
// goroutine driving the match.
