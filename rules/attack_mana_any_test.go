// The attack payment window's source membership must admit a choice-shaped
// mana source (Produced$ Any / Combo <colours> / Chosen). Before this fix
// cards.ProducedCounts reported an Any production as one COLOURLESS unit and
// the membership walk required exactly that shape; once the parser reported
// the real five-colour alternatives the old check (total == 1 && counts[5]
// == 1) rejected every Any source, so an any-colour land could no longer pay
// a generic CantAttackUnless tax. The window must also actually TAP such a
// source without losing its colour choice: resolveManaAbility resolves inline
// and a choice-shaped Produced$ would pose a mid-resolution colour ask that
// attackPayAnswer's next tap ask silently displaces (e.resume is nil for a
// window, not a suspended resolution). The membership walk therefore pins the
// choice to one concrete colour before recording the ability.
