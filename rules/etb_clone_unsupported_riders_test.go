// The two tests below pin the VALUE half of etbCloneWhitelist: a body whose
// parameter KEYS are all supported but whose value this build cannot carry
// faithfully is withheld, keeping the loud unimplemented-API fallback, rather
// than offering a copy election that would be empty (Mockingbird) or would
// silently drop the exception (Flesh Duplicate).
//
// Both drive the entry boundary directly (the shape
// TestETBChoiceIsAskedAtTheEntryBoundary uses): after the entry-boundary
// migration that is where applyETBChoiceReplacement poses an as-enters
// election, so "no election is posed there" is the whole property, and a
// direct MoveZone keeps it independent of any particular cast path.

// TestMockingbirdETBWithheld pins the resolver-dependent selector case.
// Mockingbird's Choices$ Creature.Other+cmcLEY compares against
// SVar:Y:Count$CastTotalManaSpent; every matcher on the ETB route
// (etbOptions when the ask is posed, cloneETBTemplateLegal when the
// replacement body consumes the answer) runs through MatchesSpecFrom, which
// has no SVar resolver, so the predicate answers "recognised shape, never
// matches" for every creature. Offering the election would present a list the
// player can only decline. The carrier is withheld instead.
