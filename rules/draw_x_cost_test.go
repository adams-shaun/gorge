// cost:Draw — the X-form Draw cost (Forge's Cost$ Draw<X/Spec>).
//
// The literal form Draw<N/Spec> was already modelled; the dynamic form
// Draw<X/Spec> (9 corpus carriers, all Draw<X/You>, all with a card-level
// SVar:X body) used to fall through nonManaCost to the unrecognised-symbol
// fallback, which substituted one generic mana and reported the head as the
// parameter census's `cost:Draw` label. It is now parsed as a Draw part whose
// Dyn names the source SVar, and resolved at payment by drawCostCount /
// drawCostCountTrig (the twin of fixLifeXCost for PayLife<X>).
//
// These tests pin the three legs the ticket names:
//
//   - the fold (a resolvable SVar:X resolves to its count) and the
//     fail-closed withhold (an absent/unresolvable body is not offered);
//   - the end-to-end real-corpus trigger window on Titan of Littjara, the
//     ticket's canonical carrier, with the shared creature type actually
//     configured (the entry ChooseType answered) and the positive exact
//     draw count asserted.
//
// Champion of Wits (SVar:X:Count$CardPower) is the fold's positive control:
// its body resolves to the permanent's own power. Titan of Littjara
// (SVar:X:Count$Valid Creature.YouCtrl+Other+sharesCreatureTypeWith) is the
// trigger-window pin. Neither card is in a repo deck, so no chain head or
// acceptance-ratchet row depends on these tests.

// Engine.Ask parks the asking effect's resume frame on e.resume, and wiping
// only e.pending leaves that frame armed with nothing pending — the next
// answered KChoose is then hijacked by the stale frame (handleChoose's
// mid-resolution arm runs before the e.choosing switch), which is exactly the
