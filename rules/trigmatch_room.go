// trigmatch_room.go implements Mode$ FullyUnlock, the "Eerie -- whenever
// ... you fully unlock a Room" half of the Room mechanic (CR 309; 17 corpus
// files carry the line: the Eerie enchantments, e.g. Fear of Sleep
// Paralysis). It is the OTHER-permanent sibling of Mode$ UnlockDoor
// (rules/rooms.go's checkUnlockTriggers), which is the unlocked door's OWN
// "when you unlock this door" trigger and is queued by a dedicated scan of
// the unlocked face:
//
//   - UnlockDoor lives on the Room's alternate face (the door just unlocked),
//     which the ordinary per-face walk cannot reach before the flag flips, so
//     it has a dedicated queue path.
//   - FullyUnlock lives on an unrelated permanent already on the battlefield
//     (the Eerie enchantment), so the ordinary per-face walk DOES visit it.
//     Registering the matcher is therefore all that is needed: the shared
//     ValidCard$/ValidPlayer$/TriggerZones$/Phase$ gates run before it, and
//     the ordinary TriggerPush mint carries the Execute$ body.
//
// Both modes fire on the ONE DoorUnlock event the unlock activation emits
// (rules/legal.go's "unlock" arm); no extra event kind exists, and the
// state delta stays the single Unlocked flip events.Apply performs.
//
// The two-door model: a Room enters with its cast face's door unlocked and
// exactly one locked door. Unlocking that last door IS fully unlocking the
// room, so every DoorUnlock a game action can emit is a full unlock. The
// matcher additionally requires the event to be a real locked->unlocked
// transition (the pre-fold Unlocked flag rides the event's LKI snapshot),
// so a directly-emitted repeated DoorUnlock on an already-unlocked room --
// which no game action produces -- fires nothing. That keeps "fully unlock"
// honest without inventing a second event kind or a multi-door counter.
