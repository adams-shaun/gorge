// This file is the PLAYER half of the derived-keyword surface (task
// approx-player-shroud). Until now players had no keyword machinery at all:
// a continuous static granting a keyword to a seat — True Believer's and
// Ivory Mask's `Affected$ You | AddKeyword$ Shroud`, Leyline of Sanctity's
// hexproof — emitted its ContinuousEffect like every other static (the
// layer walk in rules/layers.go) but no target walk ever read it, because
// `Affected$ You` never matches an OBJECT (matchesPlayerSingleSpec fails
// closed on an object base) and the targeting gates below were keyed on
// state.ObjID. A player so granted stayed targetable by everything.
//
// The surface is DERIVED, never stored: playerKeywords walks the same cached
// continuous-effect list every permanent's Derived() reads (e.active(), the
// one layer walk), so replay, determinism and the memo-epoch discipline are
// inherited rather than re-implemented, and a grant expires with its source
// exactly as an object's grant does. Only AddKeyword$ grants with a PLAYER
// spec are consulted (Shroud CR 702.18 and Hexproof CR 702.11 read them;
// protection CR 702.16 for players is a follow-up — see the ticket report).
// The caller owns every zone/interaction gate, exactly as shroudBlocksTarget
// and hexproofBlocksTarget's callers do for objects.

// playerKeywords returns the keywords every live continuous effect grants to
// player p through an `Affected$ <player spec> | AddKeyword$ ...` static.
// Each grant's Affects spec is judged by the shared player filter
// (effects.MatchesPlayerSpecFrom) from the STATIC'S CONTROLLER's perspective
// (the "You" of "you have shroud" is the granting card's controller), against
// the static's own source for the Chosen/IsRemembered predicates. An object-
// spec alternative (`Creature.YouCtrl`, the Card.Self default) matches no
// player — the player grammar fails closed on an object base — so the grant
// simply never reaches this surface, the same route it took before this file
// existed. The walk is e.active()'s deterministic order (sorted effects,
// fixed seat and zone slices), never a map, so the returned list is stable
// run to run and replays byte-identically.

// action's "during your turn" window is widened to any player's turn for
// every hand card p could foretell. The grant is a PLAYER keyword (the
// layer walk grants it to no object — `Affected$ You` never matches an
// object — exactly like the shroud/hexproof grants above), so the read is
// this surface, not the object Derived() walk. The entry is matched by its
// text: the head begins with Foretell and the value carries the any-turn
// modifier — the exact spelling both corpus carriers (Cosmos Charger and

// sourceHasQuality. A quality this build cannot evaluate fails closed and

// playerProtectedFrom reports whether player p carries protection from the

// You` statics whose grant reaches this surface through playerKeywords, but
// only the permanent arm of protectedFrom ever read it, so the player half
// stayed targetable. It mirrors playerHexproofBlocksTarget for players, with
// protection's asymmetry taken from CR 702.16c's quality test rather than a
// controller comparison: a plain protection grant with no quality is not a
// thing (protectionQuality yields ok=false), so every supported quality
// reads the source.
//
// The quality is judged in two steps, in this order so an unresolvable
// player spec never widens a quality the object grammar already answers:
//   - the shared source-quality evaluator (sourceHasQuality) covers the
//     colour/type words and every parameterised object spec the permanent
//     arm already evaluates (Gor Muldrak's `Salamander` is a bare type word
//     that resolves through the object filter);
//   - Forge's PLAYER-relative family (`Player.Opponent`, Absolute Virtue)
//     is not an object quality at all: the SOURCE'S CONTROLLER is judged as
//     a seat against the spec through the same shared player filter every
//     other Opponent spec resolves through, so `Player.Opponent` means "the
//     incoming source is controlled by an opponent of the protected player".
//
// A quality neither path resolves -- the Chosen-bound `ChosenType` (Serra's
// Emissary) and `ChosenName` (Runed Halo), whose value lives on the GRANTING
// static's own source object and is not carried by the flat keyword string --
// fails closed and never withholds, exactly as hexproofQuality's unresolvable
// arm does. source == 0 (no live source object) returns false for the same
// reason: no supported quality can be evaluated without it.
