// empirical check of derivedmemo.go's invalidation argument.
//
// The same binary runs the trigger walk's zone skip in verify mode
// (trigger_zoneskip.go): every skipped object is visited anyway and a visit
// that queues anything panics.
//
// The walk-scoped caches (walkcache.go) run in verify mode too: every hit is
// recomputed and a difference panics.
