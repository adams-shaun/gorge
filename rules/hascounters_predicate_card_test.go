// TestHasCountersPredicateUnlocksTargeting is the gameplay-visible leaf for
// the HasCounters `predicate` family: a real corpus card whose printed
// behaviour was broken when `Creature.HasCounters` matched NOTHING.

// Razorfin Abolisher reads:
//
//	{1}{U}, {T}: Return target creature with a counter on it to its owner's
//	hand.
//
// Its compiled ability is `A:AB$ ChangeZone | Cost$ 1 U T | ValidTgts$
// Creature.HasCounters`. With the HasCounters predicate implemented, the
// ability is offered and offers exactly the creatures that carry a counter;
// without it `Creature.HasCounters` matched NOTHING, so the ability had zero
// legal targets and was withheld entirely -- "{1}{U}, {T}: return target
// creature with a counter" could never be activated. The uncountered Grizzly
// Bears must never be offered.
