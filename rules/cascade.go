// Cascade (CR 702.85, task cascade1) — the rules-side half. The keyword is
// READ, never expanded: cards/keywords.go has no Cascade case, and both the
// printed K:Cascade line and every layer-6 AddKeyword$ Cascade grant (the
// printed S: statics the layer walk already emits AND the DB$ Effect-delivered
// statics effects' effEffect registers) reach this code through the ONE
// derived-keyword read below, the way hasCastConvoke reads Convoke.
//
// The trigger is a REAL triggered ability (CR 702.85a: "Cascade is
// triggered"): one pendingTrigger per instance is queued in the cast flow's
// pay stage, and the trigger drain mints a respondable KeywordTriggerPush
// stack object ABOVE the cascade spell. Everything observable — the
// exile-until scan, the may-cast election, the bottoming — happens when that
// ability RESOLVES (effects/cascade.go's effCascade), so the trigger can be
// responded to and countered like any other, and a free cast it begins sits
// on the stack above it exactly as CR's resolution order puts it.
//
// Deliberately NOT fired: a suspended card (mode "suspend") and a foretold
// action are not casts — payCast returns before the queue is reached — and a
// copy is never cast, so neither can cascade. A free cast (the "play" mode)
// IS a cast and cascades like any other, which is how Maelstrom Wanderer
// cascades into another cascade card (CR 702.85b's chain).
