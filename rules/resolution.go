// The mid-resolution ask: an effect that needs a player's decision in the
// middle of resolving the top of the stack (a nested Charm pick, or
// effCopySpellAbility's UnlessCost$ may-pay) poses it through
// effects.Host.Ask, and this file owns what suspends and what resumes.
//
// Suspension is a stack object staying put: resolveTop (rules/stack.go)
// runs the object's effects and, when e.resume is set after the pass,
// leaves the object on the stack and returns with a decision pending, so
// nothing before the ask gets a second chance to run and nothing moves
// until the answer arrives. Resumption re-runs the suspended sub-ability —
// the exact one that asked, never the chain prefix before it — with the
// answer attached to the Ctx, and then moves the fully-resolved object off
// the stack exactly as resolveTop's own tail would have.
//
// fx32's defect: an ask NESTED inside a mode (a Charm whose chosen mode is
// itself an asking primitive, and where the Charm — or that mode — carries
// its own SubAbility$ continuation) used to record ONE resume point and
// overwrite it at each nested ask, so the OUTER continuation the enclosing
// effect was still carrying was dropped. The resolution mechanism is now a
// chain of resume points: the innermost point holds the answer the player
// is being asked, and each point links an `outer` continuation that must
// run once everything inside it resolves. effects.Resolve reports each
// suspended loop through effects.Host.SuspendContinuation, and
// resumeResolution links those reports into the chain, so a nested ask
// finishes its own continuation AND then continues outward until the chain
// is empty — every suspended continuation runs, each exactly once.
//
// All resume state is plain value/pointer data (kind/obj plus *cards.SA
// into the shared, immutable compiled corpus, and the linked outer chain is
// rebuilt deterministically from the same stack object and the same
// recorded answers), never a closure, so Engine.Clone carries it like
// cast/choosing and a replay re-derives the same branch from the same
// recorded intent.
