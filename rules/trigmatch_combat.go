// triggerMatches case.
//
// It runs at the DECLARE-BLOCKERS ROUND COMPLETE instant (rules/turn.go's
// StepDeclareBlockers completion branch), NOT per DeclareBlockers event: those
// events are per-defender, and a defender with attackers but no legal blockers
// is skipped with no event at all, so a per-event scan of battlefield-wide
// unblocked attackers would see a later defender's not-yet-blocked attackers
// as unblocked and latch the trigger wrongly early on a split attack. At the
// completion instant every defender has answered (or been skipped), so the
// battlefield's IsAttacking && no-BlockedBy objects are exactly the unblocked
// attackers. The condition is evaluated once, here: an attacker that BECOMES
// unblocked later (its blocker leaves combat, or a stat:AssignCombatDamageAsUnblocked
// election) does not fire this trigger -- Forge checks at the end of declare
// blockers too.
//
// Fire semantics (Forge's AttackerUnblockedOnce): ONE instance per trigger per
// combat when at least one matching unblocked attacker exists -- "one or more
// creatures ... and aren't blocked" -- even when several attackers match. The
// latch (Engine.unblockedOnceFired) stamps (Turn, CombatsThisTurn) so an extra
// combat re-arms it. The matching AttackingPlayer is the first matching
// attacker's controller in the battlefield walk order.
//
// Gates mirror the AttackerBlocked hook's sequence (zone, phase, fire-count
// bound, ActivationLimit$); ValidDefenders$ and ValidAttackingPlayer$ are the
// two player specs this mode carries, both base-Player/You shapes
// effects.MatchesPlayerSpec already evaluates. Secondary$ needs no yield: a
