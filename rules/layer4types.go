// This file is the ONE bridge between rules' layer walk and the effects tier's
// ORDINARY type comparisons (a filter spec's bases and type predicates, as
// reached by a target offer, cost site, Count$Valid census or CantTarget spec).
//
// A layer-4 effect (CR 613.1d/613.1c: AddTypes$, RemoveCardTypes$,
// RemoveCreatureTypes$, AddAllCreatureTypes$, a face-down CR 708.5 set) changes
// an object's types, and only the layer walk can say which effect applies and
// which of two competing effects wins on timestamp. The layer walk already
// answers its OWN Affected$ match with a types-so-far list (SpecContext.
// ExtraTypes). But every filter OUTSIDE the walk -- the target offer a
// Goblin-killer's ValidTgts$ Goblin drives, a cost site's candidate census, a
// Count$Valid, a CantTarget -- read the printed face plus Changeling's CDA, so
// a creature a static made a Goblin was counted by a lord but not targetable
// by the Goblin-killer.
//
// The effects tier cannot import rules and must not re-derive any of that from
// a battlefield scan. So rules computes the derived type list itself and hands
// it down as DATA on the SpecContext the filter call already carries -- the
// same shape setname.go uses for layer-3 names and SpecContext.ExtraTypes
// uses for the walk's per-object types: a plain value slice, deliberately not
// a callable resolver field (which poisons escape analysis) and never a
// back-pointer from state.Game into a live engine (which would make an
// authoritative Game depend on something outside its event fold, and would
// survive a Game.Clone aimed at a different board).
//
// The table is a FIELD, refreshed after each emitted event, and specCtxSVars
// binds it with a plain field read. That is load-bearing, not a style choice:
// calling a function from inside specCtxSVars pushes it over the inline budget,
// its Resolve closure then escapes, and every SpecContext construction on the
// Derived/legal-actions hot path allocates
// (TestDerivedWithContinuousEffectsDoesNotAllocate,
// TestLegalActionsReusesActionStaticMembership). The refresh itself is gated on
// layer4InPool so a match whose cards carry no type-changing script -- most
// matches -- pays one predictable branch per event and nothing else, and it
// short-circuits on anyLayer4Active, whose precheck answers from a per-face
// derived probe and the registered-effect list without rebuilding active()
// at all, so a carrier still in a library costs one object walk. A run of
// priority bookkeeping events reuses the table outright (layercache.go).
//
// The entries are only the objects whose DERIVED list differs from the printed
// face (a handful at most, nil on the overwhelmingly common board), so the
// filter tier's linear scan is cheaper than building a map and an unchanged
// object keeps the compiled-predicate fast path (effects/filter.go's
// hasDerivedTypeEntry).

// poolHasLayer4Static reports whether any card this match can put on the
// battlefield prints a layer-4 type-changing effect. Computed once, at
// genesis, over the decks and the token table: a card outside the pool can
// never register one of these effects from its printed text. The per-card
// probe is cards.ChangesTypes -- card-data introspection, deliberately not a
// statics-parameter read on a rules path (rules/paramcensus_test.go attributes
// those to the primitive whose activeStatics root reaches them, and this probe
// has no such root because it runs before any board exists).
