// AvailableMana is the engine's answer to the view's "what could this seat
// tap for right now" question (view.Chars). It is the mana the seat could
// produce this very moment by activating the free-to-tap mana abilities of
// untapped permanents it controls -- the "free mana one gains by tapping
// lands or other effects" the seat-box line 3 advertises, as distinct from
// the floating Pool (poolView), which is a between-decisions snapshot that
// CR 500.4 empties at every step's end.
//
// It is public information: it is derived entirely from the battlefield
// (a public zone), never from a hand, library or graveyard, so the same value
// is projected for every seat and for every visibility (seat, public,
// omniscient).
//
// The eligibility gate mirrors the engine's own tap-for-mana offer
// (rules/legal.go legalActions): an untapped permanent with at least one
// unrestrictable mana ability. Beyond that gate this is deliberately
// narrower, in three honest ways the projection must not paper over:
//
//   - Only a mana ability whose activation cost is a bare tap (or free) is
//     counted. manaFreeCost rejects any cost that also sacrifices, removes
//     a counter, pays life or mana -- activating such an ability is not
//     "free mana by tapping". A permanent that is a legitimate tap source
//     but whose only mana ability carries a paid cost contributes nothing.
//   - Ability-restricted mana abilities (CantBeActivated) are skipped, the
//     same restriction legalActions' offer gate consults, so a source a
//     static currently forbids is not advertised as available.
//   - A permanent with several remaining free mana abilities contributes
//     nothing. It can tap for one of those abilities, not their sum, and
//     state.Mana cannot represent that colour choice without falsely calling
//     it colourless or promising both colours. This keeps AvailableMana a
//     conservative fixed-colour lower bound rather than overstating payment.
//   - An Indeterminate Amount$ ("X", "Y", a Count$ expression) yields no
//     amount the seat is guaranteed to receive, so it contributes nothing.
//     (mirrors cards.ManaiProduction, which resolves it to zero rather than
//     claiming a count the pool is never promised.)
//
// A summoning-sick creature is not separately excluded: the engine's own
// tap-for-mana offer gate does not exclude one either (it checks only
// Tapped), and AvailableMana is intentionally consistent with the offer set
// the seat actually acts through rather than silently diverging from it.
// Like `Cards`' production, a Produced$ of "Any"/"Combo Any" reports all
// five possible colours and no colourless unit. AvailableMana is an aggregate
// capability vector, not a claim that one tap supplies all five units: the
// activation path still asks which one the player takes. CardView.Produces
// and AvailableMana therefore share the same real alternatives, while the
// pool event records only the selected colour.

//
//   - the abilities come from availableManaAbilitiesForWindow(p, id, false),
//     so an InstantSpeed$ True ability (Lion's Eye Diamond, "Activate only as
//     an instant") is withheld -- the window genuinely cannot activate it, so
//     counting it would let the offer gate promise mana the window cannot
//     tap (the review's stranding defect);
//   - a RestrictValid$-governed ability is excluded: its produced batch may
//     not pay the cost, so counting its units would overstate reach;
//   - an Indeterminate Amount$ ("X", "Y", a Count$) yields no guaranteed
//     amount, and a choice-shaped production ("Combo B R", "Chosen") names
//     no single colour -- forward-direction symbols ("G", "R G", "RR") and

//     that needs a colour vector (UnlessCostPayable) sees exactly what the
