// station.go implements the two bespoke activated actions this ticket's
// keywords need, each with its own offer in legalActions, its own KChoose
// answer flow (handleChoose routes on the chooseFor below), and its own
// effects:
//
//   - kw:Station (CR 702.150, "Station: Tap another creature you control: Put
//     charge counters equal to its power on this Spacecraft. Station only as
//     a sorcery."): the offer is gated on the sorcery window (sorcerySpeed)
//     and on at least one legal candidate existing; the KChoose picks the
//     creature to tap; the answer emits the Tap (the cost) and the CHARGE
//     CounterChange (the effect, its amount read from the layer-derived
//     power at answer time).
//
//   - Room unlock (CR 309.5, rules/rooms.go): the offer is gated on the
//     sorcery window and on the locked half's mana cost being payable; the
//     answer pays that cost and emits the DoorUnlock event.
//
// Both follow the cleanup-discard precedent: the decision suspends nothing
// mid-resolution (no resolution is running), and the answer handler is the
// flow's whole continuation.

// chooseStation is the chooseFor for the Station tap pick. iota+13 is
// pairwise distinct from the shared package set as of the mass-turn/
// new-mechanics merge: cast=1/etb=2/miracle=3 (cast.go), cleanup=4/
// damageDivision=5 (combat.go), mana=6/manaColor=7/manaDiscard=8/
// manaExile=9 (mana_activation.go), opening=10 (opening_hand.go),
// suspendCast=11 (turn.go) -- the exact numbers only need to differ.
const chooseStation chooseFor = iota + 13

// chooseUnlock is a marker for the room-unlock flow (no second decision is
// ever asked -- the unlock pays its cost directly on the option answer) -- but
// keeping the name reserved here documents that handlePriority's "unlock"
// case never routes through handleChoose. The zero-value flow that reads it
// is the cast flow's; no handler exists, by design.
