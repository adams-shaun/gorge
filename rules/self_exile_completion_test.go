// The self-exile completion guard (task agent-20260922T150140Z-702b52c6):
// a spell whose own resolution chain moves it off the stack (Forge's
// `Origin$ Stack | Destination$ Exile` sub-ability) must keep that
// destination. The shared `moveResolvedOffStack` tail used to emit an
// unconditional stack->resting-zone move after resolution, so the spell
// landed in the graveyard despite its own exile. These tests pin the direct
// (non-suspended) resolution path -- the one `moveResolvedOffStack` serves.
// Every real card here is compiled from the corpus; no Forge script text is
// committed.

// TestBurningWishEmptySideboardKeepsSelfExile drives Burning Wish with an
// EMPTY sideboard: the outside-the-game origin offers nothing, so no search
// ask is posed and the spell resolves directly (the path
// `moveResolvedOffStack` serves, not the resumed-search path). Its own
// DBChange sub-ability exiles the spell; completion must not then emit a
// trailing stack->graveyard move. This is the direct-path sibling of
// TestChangeZoneWishFindsSideboard (which suspends on a real sideboard pick
// and so already took the guarded resumed path).
