// This file closes the "defeated" sub-shape of AGENTS.md's (battle1)
// approximation row: the defeat SBA (rules/sba.go's battleZeroDefense) exiles
// a battle with no defense counters instead of binning it to the graveyard,
// and the owner answers CR 310.11's "may cast it transformed without paying
// its mana cost" offer -- a yes pushes the card back to the stack as its BACK
// face (mode defeat_cast), a decline leaves it in exile.
//
// Invasion of Pyrulea is the carrier for the cast tests: its back face is
// Gargantuan Slabhorn, a plain 4/4 Beast with no targets, so the free cast
// needs no further decision. Both cards are in no repo deck, so these games
// never touch the golden heads.
