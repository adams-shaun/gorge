// DigUntil, RevealedDestination$ Library, RevealedLibraryPosition$ -1):
//
//   - the public reveal Note still names the revealed cards in SCAN order
//     (reveal order is a reveal-time fact and must NOT be shuffled), and
//   - the returned bottom pile is a different permutation of the revealed
//     cards — the seeded-random return order — replayed byte-identically.
//
// The no-match fixture (no Bear in the library) is used because it is the only
// one whose returned pile has more than one card, so "the reveal order and the
// return order differ" is observable. Heirloom Blade is in NO repo deck and NO
// legacy golden deck, so no chain head depends on it.
