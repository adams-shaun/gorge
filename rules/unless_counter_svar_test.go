// counterUnlessSVarCensus is the golden: every Counter SA in the compiled

// verdict the shared fold gives it. Measured 2026-09-22 at FORGE_REF
// 95f04e8a: 53 lines across 41 cards, 50 folded to a concrete amount and 3
// still hard declines because their bodies (Count$Party/Plus, Count$Domain,
// Count$Teamwork) are outside the shared evaluator.
//
// Re-measured 2026-09-23 (task api:Poison): Rune Snag's
// `SVar:Z:Number$2/Plus.Y` MOVED from `decline` to `resolves:{2}`. That is
// this diff's doing and is attributed here: `evalCountExprOK` grew the
// literal `Number$<int>` arm (the Vraska, Betrayal's Sting differential
// `SVar:Difference:Number$9/Minus.X` needs it), so Rune Snag's body is now
// evaluable and its unless-cost prices the correct {2} plus {2} per Rune
// Snag in a graveyard -- with none in any graveyard, {2}. The old `decline`
// row was a fail-closed verdict on an unevaluable body, not a rules
// judgement, so the movement is a fix rather than a regression. It is the
// only row in this census the `Number$` arm moved.
//
// A card-NAME census cannot defend this population: ten cards carry the same
// Counter body twice (once printed, once through the SVar the SubAbility
// names) and Aether Spike carries four, so a line whose classification
// changed left a name-keyed golden green. Each row here is a separate
// assertion. If the corpus pin moves or the evaluator grows a head, re-measure
// and update the row -- do not delete rows to go green.
