// TestAttachedToPredicateUnlocksCorpusTargeting is the gameplay-visible leaf
// for the two-token space grammar "AttachedTo <X>": a real corpus card whose
// printed behaviour the missing predicate broke, driven through the engine.
//
// Devout Harpist reads:
//
//	{T}: Destroy target Aura attached to a creature.
//
// Its compiled ability is `A:AB$ Destroy | Cost$ T | ValidTgts$
// Aura.AttachedTo Creature`. With the whole "AttachedTo Creature" token
// failing closed as one unknown predicate (a space is not a spec delimiter,
// so the token survives intact -- the pg1 verdict), the filter matched
// NOTHING, so abilityTargetsAvailable saw zero legal targets and withheld the
// ability entirely -- "{T}: destroy target Aura attached to a creature" could
// never be activated. With the two-token grammar in place the ability is
// offered and names exactly the Aura attached to a creature; the Aura
// attached to a land (a legal attachment, so it survives to be offered) and
// the Harpist itself must never be offered.
