// Task fx39: pin that resumeTriggerDrain is inert while a resolution is
// suspended. The suspicion being settled: turn.go's drain is guarded on
// `e.pending != nil`, and the question is whether the right guard is instead
// `e.Suspended()` (e.resume != nil). The two are not the same state in
// principle -- a resolution can be suspended with no decision pending for a
// moment, and a decision can be pending with nothing suspended -- but this
// engine wires them together: e.resume is set only inside effects' Ask
// (rules/resolution.go), which also sets e.pending, so a suspended resolution
// ALWAYS carries its own pending ask. That makes the `e.pending != nil` guard
// at least as protective as an `e.Suspended()` guard, and stronger: it also
// stops the drain from re-entering over a NON-suspended pending decision
// (the checkStateBased -> releasePending -> resumeTriggerDrain -> checkStateBased
// cycle, and the "placed triggers behind the answering player's back" bug the
// comment names).
//
// The invariant pinned here is the one that would break silently if the guard
// were weakened: calling resumeTriggerDrain while a resolution is suspended
// must do NOTHING. It must not run checkStateBased or putTriggersOnStack under
// the half-resolved object, must not grant priority to any seat, must not move
// the suspended object off the stack, and must not overwrite the outstanding
// mid-resolution ask. If a future edit removes or inverts the guard and lets
// the drain run while a resolution is sitting suspended on the stack, this test
// fails loudly instead of silently advancing the turn underneath it.
//
// Fixture choice: a REAL corpus card -- Chain Lightning -- whose
// DealDamage->CopySpellAbility chain poses a genuine mid-resolution
// UnlessCost$ ("unless_pay") ask, the repo's established suspended-resolution
// probe (see TestCR608CompletedSpellLeavesStackAfterDepartedPayer and
// TestDepartedChooserResumptionEventStreamIsDeterministic). No manufactured
// SAs; the ask is reached through the real cast/resolve path. Three seats so
// the game keeps running while the ask sits (a two-seat game would end when
// the damage completes).
