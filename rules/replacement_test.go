// Task 19: Defined$ ReplacedCard. A replacement's ReplaceWith$ could not
// name the object the replaced event was about: effects/context.go's Defined
// fell back to Ctx.Targets (nil for a replacement context) for every
// "ReplacedCard" script, so a Rest in Peace / Dryad Militant / Leyline of
// the Void-shaped replacement ("if a card would be put into a graveyard from
// anywhere, exile it instead") relocated NOTHING -- the card it was supposed
// to exile stayed wherever it was, and resolveTop's totality guard
// (ensureLeftTheStack) had to park it in exile as a backstop. This task
// wires the pair: rules/replacement.go sets Ctx.Replaced to the object the
// replaced event was about, and Defined$ ReplacedCard yields it.
//
// Card text below is authored for this test, in the same R:/SVar$ shape as
// the corpus cards that found the bug -- never copied from Forge's
// .cards/cardsfolder.
