// potentialUnbounded is the per-unit amount one indeterminate mana source
// contributes to the hypothetical potential pool. A source whose Amount$ is
// an X, a Y or a Count$ expression (an Urza land, Gaea's Cradle, Priest of
// Titania) could produce any amount this turn; the stop decision the
// projection serves must never lose an action to a source the engine cannot
// statically price, so such a source is priced unbounded rather than at zero.
// 99 is far past any real cost a game can present, while staying small enough
// that sums of a few sources cannot overflow int32.
const potentialUnbounded int32 = 99

// PotentialMana is the hypothetical pool the potential-action walk prices
// against: the seat's floating pool PLUS what every untapped mana source it
// controls could produce. It is deliberately an OVER-bound, the direction the
// auto-pass doctrine names safe (a wrongly withheld pass costs one idle stop;
// a wrongly eaten window loses the player's action):
//
//   - a source with a single fixed-colour production (a Plains) adds its
//     literal Amount (default 1);
//   - a source with several fixed productions (a Volcanic Island's two
//     abilities, a "Produced$ GW" line) adds every face -- the seat can only
//     tap for one at a time, but the bound must not lose a colour;
//   - a source with an alternative or variable production (Produced$ Any /
//     Combo Any / Chosen / an unknown token) or an indeterminate Amount$ (an
//     Urza land, Gaea's Cradle, Elvish Archdruid) contributes
//     potentialUnbounded to EVERY unit -- the one shape a fixed vector cannot
//     represent honestly, and the shape the old client-side bound priced at
//     zero (the Tron + Karn defect);
//   - a mana ability WITH a paid activation cost (Wasteland's
//     "T, Sac<1/CARDNAME>", a "{1}, {T}: add {C}{C}" source) still counts, and
//     it counts even though the real floating pool does not already cover its
//     cost: the seat can tap a free source first, spend that mana on the paid
//     activation, and then tap the paid source. PotentialMana therefore runs a
//     FIXPOINT -- a source's paid mana ability is admitted the moment the
//     accumulated pool can cover its activation cost, and its own production
//     then feeds the next source -- so the pool grows the way a player would
//     actually sequence the activations (the Jitte-round finding: a Plains
//     plus an untapped "{1}, {T}: add {C}{C}" source must cover a {2} spell,
//     because the seat taps the Plains for {W}, pays the {1} to activate the
//     source, and casts from the {C}{C} it produced).
//
// Restriction-gated abilities (CantBeActivated) contribute nothing, and a
// source's own production never pays for that source's own paid activation
// (a source is admitted only when the pool built from OTHER sources already
// covers its cost, and each source contributes at most once -- the same
// single-tap-per-source semantics the engine's own tap-for-mana offer uses).
// The aggregate is a pure read: no event is emitted and no state field is
// written; the pool lives only in this return value.
//
// Determinism: the walk is over zone order, never a map range (the added set
// is only indexed, never ranged), so the aggregate is byte-stable run to run.
