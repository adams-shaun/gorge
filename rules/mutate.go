// Mutate (CR 702.140) is a cast mode on a creature card printed with
// K:Mutate:<cost>. Casting the spell for its mutate cost targets a non-Human
// creature its controller owns, and the mutating card is put over or under
// that creature as it resolves (CR 702.140b): the resulting permanent is the
// top card with all abilities of the cards beneath it (CR 702.140d), and a
// "whenever this creature mutates" trigger fires (CR 702.140f).
//
// This file owns the keyword's cast shape (mutateCost), the synthesized
// target declaration (mutateTargetSA) and the resolution that emits the
// events.Mutate fold. The pile itself is state.Object.MergedCards, folded by
// events.Apply (CR 702.140d) and read by the trigger/static scans.

// mutateCost resolves the keyword's mutate cost (CR 702.140a), Forge's
// K:Mutate:<cost>. It follows the replicateCost/bestowCost convention: a cost
// carrying a token ParseCost cannot model withholds the cast offer rather
// than charging a degraded generic. The mutating card's own printed mana cost
// is ignored -- the mutate cost is paid INSTEAD.
//
// The keyword parameter is occasionally followed by Forge's trailing fields;
// only the first colon-free field is the cost (no corpus mutate cost itself
// contains a colon -- they are all plain mana symbols and hybrids, measured
// over all 34 raw K:Mutate lines).

// mutateTargetSA is the target declaration a mutate cast announces: CR
// 702.140a's "target non-Human creature you own". The creature face carries
// no SP of its own for the mutation, so this hand-built SA stands in for the
// face's spell ability at the target ask (rules/cast.go) and at resolution
// (rules/stack.go), exactly the bestowedAttachSA precedent -- never added to
// the face, which would make the PLAIN creature cast target-bearing.
//
// `Card.Self` is deliberately absent: the mutate target is the creature that
// becomes the pile's bottom (or top), not the spell's own card. YouOwn (not
// YouCtrl) is the oracle wording and the one the non-Human filter reads.
