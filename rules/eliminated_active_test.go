// Task E1b — CR 800.4j: "If a player leaves the game during their turn, that
// turn continues to its completion without an active player. If the active
// player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order
// receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or
// step ends, whichever is appropriate."
//
// This task writes tests only. It pins the behaviors that make 800.4j true in
// gorge, and it exists so that a future edit which ends an eliminated active
// player's turn early (the parked-but-discarded endTurnForEliminatedActivePlayer
// approach, or any re-derivation of it) is caught by a named test rather than
// silently degrading real magic: the turn MUST continue, the departed seat MUST
// never be handed a decision, and a living seat's end-step trigger MUST still
// fire.
//
// The fixtures below are ours, fresh from the CR rather than ported from the
// parked branch (which used this file's name). drainerSrc/gainerSrc are reused
// from trigger_order_test.go because drainerSrc is exactly the repo's existing
// self-elimination fixture: it loses the controller's ENTIRE life total on an
// upkeep trigger, so a controller on their own turn is eliminated mid-turn.

// endGainSrc is a living seat's end-of-turn trigger (behaviour 4's fixture),
// modelled on gainerSrc/drainerSrc: it gains its controller 5 life "at the
// beginning of the end step". On a correctly-continuing turn an eliminated
// active player's turn still HAS an end step, so a living seat's trigger
// still fires there.
//
// Phase$ matching is a substring test (trigger_match.go phaseMatches:
// strings.Contains(step.String(), "end")), so Phase$ End resolves at BOTH
// end-combat and the end step of a completed turn. That is the engine's
// current behaviour (and a real-card quirk this task does not own), so a
// correctly-completed turn fires this trigger once (end-combat), then once
// more (end): 5 life each. The assertion below deliberately frames the
// guarantee as "seat 2's life increased by an end-of-turn firing of 5,"
// which is what a turn-ending mutation removes and this test pins.

// elimActiveScenario builds a three-seat game in which seat 1 is eliminated

// LIVING seat (2) carries a Phase-End trigger that must still fire on seat 1's
// continuing turn. Returns the engine parked at turn 2's upkeep: seat 1 still
// alive, the drain trigger already on the stack, and a priority decision for
// seat 1 pending (which is what the writer will then pass through the rest of
// the turn).
//
// seat 1 is chosen so a single driveToStep reaches the elimination cleanly:

// genesis, so they miss the already-past turn 1 upkeep). seat 1 eliminates

// this task adds no production code. That bare event carries no DecisionAsk
// behind it: grantPriority re-points the actual grant to NextAlive, so the
