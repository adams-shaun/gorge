// Mount Velus Manticore, end to end on the real compiled corpus (task
// cli-20260924T092757Z-74f4f54a): "At the beginning of combat on your turn,
// you may discard a card. When you do, CARDNAME deals X damage to any
// target, where X is the number of card types the discarded card has."
//
// The trigger's chain is `Discard | Mode$ TgtChoose | RememberDiscarded$
// True | SubAbility$ DBImmediateTrigger`, and the payoff SVar is
// `X:TriggerRemembered$CardTypes`. Before that reference was resolved the
// damage was 0 whatever was discarded; the assertion below pins the number
// of card types of the remembered (discarded) card as the damage.
//
// A second engine with a SINGLE-type discard runs the same chain, so the
// test cannot pass on "the trigger always deals some fixed amount": the two
// damages differ by exactly the difference in card types.
