// keyword prints real rules text: "When this creature enters, target player
// may put Laurine into their hand from their library, then shuffle." No
// carrier's script prints that ability separately, so the expansion must
// synthesize it; without the expansion Kamber's face carries the keyword as a
// bare, behaviourless label.
//
// The test walks the whole ability:
//  1. PRECONDITION: the corpus Kamber face carries the synthesized
//     Partner-with trigger (fails loudly if the expansion regressed or the
//     corpus pin moved), and the named partner is actually in the library.
//  2. entering Kamber poses the trigger's target-player ask;
//  3. the search asks seat 0 and offers exactly the named partner, not some
//     other library card -- the Card.named<name> filter's whole point,
//     exercised on a name that carries a raw comma;
//  4. taking it moves Laurine to hand and shuffles exactly once (CR 701.23:
