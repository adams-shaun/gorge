// TestResumptionRunsOuterContinuationAfterNestedAsk is the F19 resumption
// coverage for the one shape the suspension half's tests do not reach: a
// mid-resolution ask nested INSIDE a Charm mode, where the Charm carries its
// OWN SubAbility$ continuation AFTER the mode.
//
// The suspension half (a head-of-chain Discard/Charm ask suspending the
// resolution and posing a KModes decision, with a chained SubAbility$ running
// once the answer lands) is covered by TestThoughtseizeLosesExactlyTwoLife and
// TestCharmSubAbilityRunsOnce. Neither reaches the nested shape: there, the
// inner ask's resume point OVERWRITES the outer one, so the engine re-enters
// at the inner SA and never walks the Charm's own continuation.
//
// This card resolves to: choose a mode (DoDiscard), the mode itself discards
// a card via a mid-resolution TgtChoose ask, the mode's own chained
// SubAbility$ (DBSub, lose 10) must then fire once, and — the part on trial —
// the Charm's own SubAbility$ (DBLife, lose 1) must fire once AFTER both, with
// the discard answer already applied (the chosen card visible in the
// graveyard). Correct resolution: the caster loses 11 total over two distinct
// lose-life events.

// TestResumptionRunsEveryContinuationAtDepthThree is the depth-3 case that

// nested TWO levels below the outermost continuation. A single-slot resume
// point and a one-deep fix both pass a depth-2 test while still dropping the
// middle and outer continuations here, so this is what pins the fix as a
// chain, not a patch.
//
// The card is a Charm whose chosen mode is a Repeat, whose Repeated
// sub-ability is the Discard (the asking primitive), with a continuation
// after EACH of the three levels:
//
//	charm1SA: Charm | Choices DoRepeat,DoGain | SubAbility$ Out       (level-0 cont)
//	DoRepeat: SP$ Repeat | RepeatSubAbility$ DoDiscard | SubAbility$ Mid (level-1 cont)
//	DoDiscard: DB$ Discard | Mode$ TgtChoose | SubAbility$ Inn          (asking, level-2 cont)
//
// Two mid-resolution KModes asks fire in sequence — the Charm mode, then the
// discard TgtChoose — and after the discard answer is applied the inner
// (Inn), middle (Mid) and outer (Out) continuations must each run exactly
// once, in that order: 1 + 2 + 3 life lost over three distinct
// lose-life events. The chosen card must already be in the graveyard when any
// continuation fires, proving the answer's effect is applied first.
//
// Note this shape is deliberately a Repeat at the middle level, not a second
// Charm: effCharm resolves a chosen mode by handing it the SAME Ctx (whose
// Modes the parent already set), so a Charm invoked AS a mode inherits that
// Modes value and re-resolves itself endlessly. Repeat has no such coupling,
// so it is the one expressible two-level carrier.
