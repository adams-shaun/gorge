// speed.go implements the "Start your engines!" mechanic (CR 702.163; 47
// corpus files carry the keyword). Speed is a per-seat count
// (state.Player.Speed) that never resets; max speed is 4. Two engine rules:
//
//   - CR 702.163a: while a player controls a permanent with "Start your
//     engines!", if they have no speed (0), it becomes 1. Emitted from the
//     one emit path when such a permanent ENTERS the battlefield under them
//     (checkSpeedStart, called from Engine.emit's MoveZone fold).
//   - CR 702.163b: a player's speed increases once each turn when an
//     opponent loses life, up to max speed -- including another player's
//     turn. A player with NO speed (0 -- no Start your engines! permanent
//     yet) does not gain: the increase rule is speed's own, and it applies
//     to players who have speed. Emitted after the folded LifeChange loss
//     (checkSpeedGain).
//
// The once-per-turn gate is derived from the event log (the SpeedChange
// events already emitted this turn), never from a live counter, so a replay
// re-executes to the same gains. Max speed is a cap: a seat at 4 gains
// nothing further, and events.Apply clamps defensively too.

// maxSpeed is CR 702.163b: speed cannot go above 4.
const maxSpeed = 4

// with a negative Amount (a loss) and after every positive player-D Damage
// event (combat and spell/ability damage fold straight to the life total,
// and a Damage event that reaches emit has already been through prevention
// -- a prevented hit is a Note, never a Damage -- so a positive player-arm
// Damage event IS a landed loss). Every living player WITH speed gains one
// speed when an opponent of theirs lost the life (any other seat -- CR
// 800.4k: in a free-for-all every other player is an opponent); at most one
// gain per turn, and never past max speed. More than one player may qualify
// for the same loss on another player's turn. The gain itself is an ordinary
