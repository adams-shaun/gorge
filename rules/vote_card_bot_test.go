// vote_card1 (round 2): the card-ballot bot vote must reach the ballot
// facts in a REAL match. Round 1 gave botpolicy.Decide a vote_card arm that
// votes for the highest-worth offered permanent, but both Board adapters
// (botpolicy.BoardFromGameInto, seat's boardFromView) filled b.Cards from
// the deciding seat's own zones alone — a Council's Judgment ballot offers
// only permanents the CASTER does not control, so every entry read as a
// zero Card and the strict `>` comparison always retained option 0: the
// bot voted the ballot's first entry in every real match while the round-1
// unit test injected the facts by hand and hid exactly that. The adapter
// widening is under test in seat/integration_test.go's agreement pins; this
// file pins the behaviour end to end on the real corpus card, answered
// through the production bot path (testBot.answer = botpolicy.Decide over
// botpolicy.BoardFromGame, the same Board host/match.go builds a bot seat).
