// Task cli-20260923T060000Z-equip-reduce (the eqcm1 row's Targeted$ sub-shape):
// an equip cost reduction whose body reads a ROOT target ref used to resolve
// to 0 at the OFFER gate, so the ability was withheld at full price unless the
// controller happened to have the undiscounted amount available. The charge
// became target-aware earlier (alltargeted1's repriceForTargets), but the
// offer gate and beginActivation still folded a nil-target read of 0, so a
// `{10}` equip against a 4-power creature cost `{6}` yet was not offered from
// a `{6}` pool. ownReduceCostOffer now resolves the body against the best
// legal root target for the offer price (and beginActivation folds the same
// amount), while repriceForTargets still charges the amount for the target
// actually chosen at CR 601.2c. These leaves pin both halves on the real
// corpus Belt of Giant Strength (`K:Equip:10:::ReduceCost$ X` with
// `SVar:X:Targeted$CardPower`), the card the row names.
