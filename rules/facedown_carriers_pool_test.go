// facedown_carriers_pool_test.go — the other half of the face-down carrier
// discipline TestFaceDownCarriersAreNotInRepoDecks asserts. That test scans
// only LegacyDeckNames, the closed 12-deck pool rules/heads_test.go's TestHeads
// seats from. This one pins, from the deck-import side, that the carriers the
// Deadly Disguise precon legitimately brings in stay OUT of that pool, so the
// narrowing in the guard is a measured decision and not an accidental blind
// spot. It is the class-level check: any future deck that carries a carrier
// must be kept out of the head-pinned pool, and the pool itself must stay the
// closed 12.
