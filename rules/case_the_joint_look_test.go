// The multi-target bare look's pacing ack, pinned END TO END on the real
// corpus card (lookack, task fb-20260917T232325Z-35cfca4b; the r2 review's
// CRITICAL): Case the Joint ("Draw two cards, then look at the top card of
// each player's library") carries `DB$ PeekAndReveal | Defined$ Player |
// NoReveal$ True`, and `Defined$ Player` resolves to BOTH seats — so the
// resolution walk holds two bare-look targets. The r1 gate consumed its
// answered flag at the FIRST bare-look target, so the later target's ack was
// never marked answered and every resume re-emitted the earlier notes and
// re-posed the later ack forever: a live table wedged on an endless Continue
// modal while the log filled with duplicate Secret notes. The per-target
// cursor (LookAckTarget = the decision's ResumeTarget, the DigTarget
// pattern) makes the chain terminate: one Continue and one Secret note per
// target, each prompt naming that target's own top library card.
