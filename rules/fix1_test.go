// TestPlayLandReplayThroughSubmit is the Task 13 fix-round regression test

// branch's own Priority-reset emit or the LandPlayed emit at all.
//
// The action under test is driven through the public Submit path only --
// never handlePriority or legalActions directly.
//
// Two things make this test actually capable of catching a regression back
// to a direct field write, rather than passing either way:
//
//  1. Passes is forced to a nonzero value immediately before the action.
//     Entering a step naturally starts Passes at 0 (advanceStep's own emit
//     resets it), so testing straight off a step change could never tell
//     an emitted reset apart from a stale value that already happened to
//     be 0.
//  2. The other seat is eliminated immediately before the action, so this
//     Submit is the one that ends the game. priorityRound emits a fresh
//     Priority(holder, Passes) event before every decision it asks, and
//     Submit always calls Advance (which calls priorityRound again) right
//     after handling an intent -- so on any non-terminal action, that next
//     round's honest emit would re-broadcast the correct live values into
//     the log regardless of whether THIS action's own reset went through
//     emit or a bypassing direct write, silently curing the omission. Only
//     when no further priority round ever runs -- i.e. the action ends the
//     game -- does omitting the emit leave the log genuinely short a step,
//     which is what the replay comparison below is able to detect.
