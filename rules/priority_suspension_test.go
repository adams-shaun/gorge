// TestSuspendedResolutionLogsPriorityOnlyAtCompletion pins the priority-log
// contract this task restores: CR 117.5, nobody receives priority in the
// middle of a resolution. When a resolution suspends on a mid-resolution ask
// (a modal spell's KModes, an unless-pay, a discard), the engine is parked on
// that question and NOTHING has priority — so the log must carry no Priority
// event between the mid-resolution DecisionAsk and the answer. Before the
// fix (rules/legal.go) the pass-branch's pass-count reset emit ran
// unconditionally and logged Priority{active} right after that DecisionAsk,
// while the resolution was still suspended: a log lie, and the source of the
// host boundsOf mis-derivation.
//
// The companion property: once the resolution completes, the pass count
// resets and the "back to active" marker lands AFTER the object leaves the
// stack (the completion grant in rules/resolution.go, plus the normal
// grantPriority tail), never during the suspension. The engine's established
// shape for a completed resolution is the reset marker immediately followed by
// the round grant, so the leaf asserts the reset-with-zero holds after the
// object's completion move rather than counting Priority events (the two-event
// convention is the same for an unsuspended resolution, pinned elsewhere).

// TestMidCastManaWindowLogsNoPriorityBetweenAskAndAnswer pins the CAST-TIME
// half of the same CR 117.5 / CR 117.3c contract that
// TestSuspendedResolutionLogsPriorityOnlyAtCompletion pins for a
// mid-RESOLUTION ask: nobody receives priority in the middle of an
// announcement. A cast that parks on a mid-cast ask leaves the engine waiting
// on an unanswered question (CR 601.2g's mana window, where the caster
// activates mana abilities before paying 601.2h) -- so the log must carry no
// Priority event between that DecisionAsk and its answer.
//
// The documented site is rules/stack.go's handleTarget cast branch: after
// payCast it emits the CR 117.3c "caster keeps priority" marker, and payCast
// can park on the 601.2g window. Before the guard (the `else` instead of
// `else if e.pending == nil`) that marker was emitted while the cast was
// still parked, logging a Priority immediately after the window's DecisionAsk
// and before its answer -- an `ask -> priority` adjacency inside one burst,
// exactly the class of log lie that breaks host/snapshot.go's boundsOf
// invariant (derived 1371, recorded 1372 on main). This leaf is what guards
// that line: a future regression reverting it to an unconditional emit makes
// the "no Priority between ask and answer" assertion below fail.
//
// Reaching the window through the public cast offer is impossible by design:
// the offer gate (castable) requires the pool alone to pay, while the window
// poses only when the pool alone does NOT pay. The window is therefore
// reached (as the CR 601 conformance lane already does) by beginning the cast
// directly, bypassing the offer gate -- the same white-box entry the 601.2g
// leaf uses. A targeted spell (so handleTarget runs on the cast path), an
// empty pool, and an untapped Mountain on the battlefield is the shape that
// parks payCast on the window after the target is chosen.
