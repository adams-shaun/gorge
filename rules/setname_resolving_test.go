// TestResolvingEffectNameFilterSeesSetNameRename closes the setname1 remainder
// that the SpecContext-only bridge left open: a filter call made by a RESOLVING
// effect -- not one rules builds for the layer walk or a static -- must read
// the CR 613.1c layer-3 name, not the printed face.
//
// The seam is effects.Resolve: rules' Engine implements effects' optional
// nameTableHost, so the top of every Resolve walk publishes the current rename
// table onto the resolving Ctx, which propagates it through
// (*Ctx).SpecContext and Ctx.MatchSpec. An effects test double with no such
// host method leaves it nil and reads the printed face (the documented
// fallback), so this is a value-slice publication, not a state.Game
// back-pointer.
//
// The effect is a real resolving primitive: a DB$ SacrificeAll whose
// ValidCards$ names the renamed creature, driven exactly as SubAbility$ drives
// it (effects.Resolve with the chain's Ctx). It asserts both directions --
// the renamed bear is sacrificed, and the never-renamed elf survives -- and
// its own preconditions: the layer walk must name the bear, the effective name
// must differ from the printed one, and a Ctx that never went through Resolve
// must NOT see the rename (otherwise the test would pass with the wiring
// absent).
