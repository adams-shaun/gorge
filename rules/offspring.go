// Offspring (CR 702.175) — the optional ADDITIONAL cast cost, and the 1/1
// token copy it creates on entry. Four pieces:
//
//   - offspringCost resolves the printed K:Offspring:<cost> parameter, OR a
//     layer-6 AddKeyword$ Offspring:<cost> grant that reaches the cast spell
//     (Zinnia, Valley's Voice's "Creature spells you cast have offspring
//     {2}"). It reads the DERIVED keyword list with the stack-zone override
//     (derivedWith's atStack), the exact read hasCastConvoke makes, so a
//     granted offspring is priced at the cast offer and the granted cost —
//     never the printed one — is charged.
//   - the offer (rules/legal.go) exposes a distinct "cast (offspring)"
//     option paying base + offspring, the Buyback shape (Offspring is an
//     additional cost, so it is base.Plus(offspring), never a substitution
//     like Bestow/Mutate).
//   - modeFlags marks FlagOffspringPaid, the pay-time provenance the
//     keyword expansion's ETB trigger reads through Count$OffspringPaid.
//   - cards/kw_offspring.go's expansion mints the 1/1 token copy when that
//     count is nonzero.
//
// Unlike Squad (an "any number of times" count ask), Offspring is paid at
// most once and the election is the offer itself, so there is no decision
// ask: Paying is the option, declining is the plain cast option beside it.

// offspringRawParam returns the Offspring keyword parameter reaching the cast
// spell: the parameter of the FIRST derived keyword whose head is Offspring.
// The derived list (derivedWith with the stack-zone override) already
// carries the printed K: line plus every layer-6 AddKeyword$ grant whose
// AffectedZone$ scope reaches the cast, so a single read covers both the
// printed and the Zinnia-granted forms — and the two cannot disagree about
// which cost the cast pays.

// (ok false) when the parameter is missing or carries a token ParseCost
// cannot model — the replicateCost/bestowCost fail-closed convention, so an

// non-mana part is accepted and its payability decided by the ordinary offer
// gate, exactly like any other additional cost.
