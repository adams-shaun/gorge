// vote_card_self1 (round 3): a card ballot's bot vote must not exile the
// VOTER's own permanent when a foreign one is offered. Council's Judgment's
// VoteCard$ excludes only the CASTER's permanents ("a nonland permanent you
// don't control"), so at 3+ seats every other seat's permanents — including
// the voter's OWN — are on the ballot. The round-2 policy ranked every
// offered option by worth and so had a voter pick its own highest-worth
// permanent over an opponent's lower-worth one; the option carried no
// controller, so the policy could not tell them apart. `askCardVote` now
// stamps each option's subject controller on Option.Player (public under CR
// 400.2), and the policy ranks the non-self options first.
//
// This is the REAL compiled corpus card, answered through the production bot
// path (testBot.answer = botpolicy.Decide over botpolicy.BoardFromGame, the
// same Board a hosted bot seat builds), at three seats where a two-seat game
// cannot show the defect (there the ballot holds only one seat's permanents).
