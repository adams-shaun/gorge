// The attack/block prop payment windows must resolve the EXACT alternative a
// tap answer selected. Round 1 widened the window to one option per priceable
// ability but identified every option only by its Obj: a permanent with two
// free abilities producing DIFFERENT quantities (one {C}, one {C}{C}) had its
// budget counted at the maximum (2), a {2} charge was offered, and selecting
// the second option still activated the FIRST ability -- the payer came up
// short and the declaration aborted. The window now stores the posed tap list
// and resolves the chosen option's Index, and each option's label names its
// production, so the alternatives are distinguishable on the wire and the
// handler activates the ability that was selected.
