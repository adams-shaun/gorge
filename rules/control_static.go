// Static control statics: an S:Mode$ Continuous static carrying GainControl$
// (Mind Control's "You control enchanted creature", Fealty to the Realm's
// "The monarch controls enchanted creature") is realized here, on top of the
// ordinary control-grant tracker (rules/control.go) rather than as a layer-2
// view. The scan (rules/layers.go's staticEffects) stays PURE: it emits a
// ContinuousEffect carrying only the GainControl$ value and the Affected$
// spec, no callbacks, no emits. The reconcile below is the one place the
// static becomes real:
//
//   - reconcileControlStatics runs at the same fixed points expireControl
//     does (Engine.emit's tail for every state-changing event, and the SBA
//     safety net), derives the WANTED set -- for every live GainControl
//     static, every battlefield object its Affected$ matches, the player the
//     value names -- and registers a real tracked grant plus emits
//     events.ControlChange wherever the object's controller actually differs;
//
//   - ENDING is not the reconcile's job: a static grant is marked `static`
//     and its grantEnded reads the same wanted set -- a grant whose static
//     stopped being live (source left the battlefield, the "as long as" gate
//     flipped, the Aura moved bearers, the named player changed) ends inside
//     the ordinary expireControl pass, and the bearer returns to its
//     Previous controller through the ordinary chain. That is what keeps the
//     stacking contract: a Threaten (temporary steal) on top of a Mind
//     Control static stacks in begin order, and when the Threaten expires
//     the bearer returns to the static's controller, not its owner.
//
// Everything is a deterministic function of the current state driven from
// the same emit paths a replay re-executes, so a replayed game re-derives
// identical grants and identical ControlChange events. No map is ranged
// where order can reach an event: seats walk AliveFrom(0), zones are slices,
// the static memo is the scan's own emission order.

// staticWant is one wanted static control transfer: the SOURCE object (the
// Aura carrying the static, stamped so a returned Aura is a new object, CR
// 400.7), the bearer it currently holds, and the controller the static names.
