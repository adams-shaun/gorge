// vote-tally-resume: api:Vote's per-subject tally (Ctx.VoteCounts) was lost
// when an AmountFromVotes$ RepeatEach iteration suspended on a downstream
// mid-resolution ask. Círdan the Shipwright is the live corpus carrier: its
// DBRepeatPut walks every player, and a player who received no votes may put
// a permanent card from their hand onto the battlefield -- a hidden-hand
// ChangeZone that poses a real KChoose when the player holds more than one
// eligible permanent. Answering it suspends the loop; the resumed body and
// every remaining iteration then re-derive their per-player "Votes" value,
// which the pre-fix engine read off the (now-empty) fresh Ctx as 0.
//
// This test drives the real compiled card through the real vote, a real
// hidden-hand choice answered with a NON-FIRST option, and asserts both
// halves of the outcome: a later player who received votes must NOT take the
// zero-vote branch, while a later zero-vote player still must.
