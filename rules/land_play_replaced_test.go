// A land play whose battlefield entry is FULLY replaced (Forge's
// ReplacementResult$ Replaced: the move is discarded and the ReplaceWith$ body
// happens instead) still uses that turn's land play. Playing a land is a
// special action taken as it is announced (CR 305.1, CR 505.5b); a replacement
// changes where the land ends up, never whether it was played.
//
// The entry-boundary ETB migration moved LandPlayed behind the land's own
// MoveZone so an as-enters choice is answered as the land enters. That
// finalizer only fires for a land that actually reaches the battlefield, so a
// replaced entry used to log no LandPlayed at all -- the player kept their land
// drop -- and left the continuation armed for a later, unrelated entry of the
// same object to consume.
//
// Card text below is authored for this test in the same R:/SVar$ shape as the
// corpus cards, never copied from Forge's .cards/cardsfolder.
