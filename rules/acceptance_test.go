// knownUnsupported is the M1 coverage RATCHET (Ruling P12/D2-a): the exact
// card -> missing-primitive set TestEveryRepoDeckIsFullySupported measured
// on its first run against the 12 repo decks, checked in by hand. The test
// below asserts the MEASURED set equals this table EXACTLY, in both
// directions -- a newly-missing card is a regression, a table entry that is
// now fully supported is stale and must be deleted -- so, for a fixed deck
// catalogue, this table only ever shrinks, and only by implementing a real
// primitive (Ruling W2: this project does not grow the "supported" set just
// to make the ratchet green). Adding a newly imported deck can extend the
// measured worklist; its entries must be measured from the compiled corpus,
// never marked supported without an implementation.
//
// Measured 2026-09-04 against the compiled IR cache at .cards/ir.gob.gz
// (corpus master @ 95f04e8a04c8925fa97cb226fc3341cabcc90a53): originally 35
// of the 136 distinct cards across the 12 decks needed at least one
// primitive this build did not implement -- overwhelmingly individual
// keywords (kw:Equip, kw:Flash, kw:Kicker, kw:Delve, kw:Undying,
// kw:etbCounter, kw:Storm, and so on) rather than whole missing APIs. The
// M2r plan's "Ratchet schedule" table
// (docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-05-gorge-m2r-ratchet-to-zero.md) is the
// authority on which task retires each entry, down to 0; this table stood
// at 31 after Task 3 (kw:Flash, kw:Indestructible and kw:Devoid retire
// Snapcaster Mage, Spectral Sailor, Ulamog and World Breaker), at 29 after
// Task 13 (api:Token registers, deleting Wurmcoil Engine's and Young
// Pyromancer's entries outright and shrinking Batterskull's, Empty the
// Warrens' and Entreat the Angels' entries to whatever else they still need
// -- kw:Living Weapon's own Attach/Equip is Task 14's, Storm and
// CopySpellAbility and Miracle are each a separate, still-open primitive),
// and now stands at 22 (Task 9: kw:Kicker, kw:Surge, kw:Flashback and
// kw:Delve retire Gatekeeper of Malakir, Goblin Bushwhacker, Vines of
// Vastwood, Reckless Bushwhacker, Cabal Therapy, Gurmag Angler and
// Tombstalker), and at 18 after Task 16 (kw:Undying, kw:Evolve, kw:Exalted
// and kw:Prowess register: Geralf's Messenger, Strangleroot Geist, Experiment
// One and Monastery Swiftspear retire outright, and Knight of Infamy shrinks
// to just its still-open kw:Protection from white). Every unimplemented
// ability on these
// cards is inert for the acceptance run (Ruling U13's Sword of Fire and Ice
// note is this same shape, one card up): the point of Task 26 is that the
// games terminate, invariants hold and replay is exact with these cards
// shuffled in, not that every card plays with full fidelity yet -- that is
// M4's coverage work, and this table is its worklist.
//
// Task 14 (attachments) registered api:Attach, kw:Equip, kw:Enchant and
// kw:Living Weapon, deleting Batterskull, Rancor, Sword of Fire and Ice and
// Umezawa's Jitte outright -- the four entries whose only gaps were those
// primitives.
//
// Merge wt/r14 <- main (Task 14 fix round 1): main's M2r tasks retired nine
// of the eighteen post-Task-16 entries before this branch merged -- Task 18's
// kw:Miracle (Entreat the Angels, Terminus), Task 12's ETB replacement +
// as-enters choice machinery (api:ChooseType/api:ChooseNumber/kw:ETBReplacement
// /kw:etbCounter: Cavern of Souls, Phyrexian Revoker, Pithing Needle, Sanctum
// Prelate, Chalice of the Void, Endless One, Walking Ballista) -- and Task 14
// above retired the four attachment entries, so the merged table is exactly
// the five entries BOTH sides still listed: the two CopySpellAbility+Storm
// pairs, and the two Protection entries, nothing else. It now stands at 5.
//
// Task 17 (Storm and CopySpellAbility) registered api:CopySpellAbility and
// kw:Storm, deleting Chain Lightning, Empty the Warrens and Tendrils of Agony
// outright -- three more of the post-Task-16 entries -- leaving only the two
// Protection entries.
//
// Task 15 (protection) registered the five kw:Protection from <colour>
// keywords, retiring Goblin Piledriver (Protection from blue) and Knight of
// Infamy (Protection from white) -- the last two entries on this table -- so
// the ratchet became EMPTY for the original Legacy and interim Commander
// decks. The Hearthhull and Valgavoth imports add 54 measured gaps across 579
// distinct cards in the pinned corpus; entries retire only when their
// primitives are implemented. The untap/mana wave (api:Untap, api:ManaReflected,
// stat:ManaConvert, stat:UntapOtherPlayer and kw:Cumulative upkeep)
// retired Fabled Passage, Exotic Orchard, Baloth Prime, Horizon Explorer and
// Chromatic Orrery outright (every entry's primitives are implemented). The
// one recorded remainder for Horizon Explorer is the param-level gap
// `param:api:Untap.ETB` in paramcensus_test.go's knownUnsupportedParams.
//
// Task altcosts (the alternative-cost keyword family) retired the one entry
// the merged decks carried: kw:Dash (Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer), implemented
// to CR 702's dash shape in rules/altcast.go with a named proof test in
// rules/altcast_test.go. kw:Evoke, kw:Encore, kw:Overload, kw:Warp,
// kw:Madness and kw:AlternateAdditionalCost registered in the same task for
// the commander decks then held: Rakdos Scam.exe and Ulalek Eldrazi have
// since been imported and measured fully supported (no entry of theirs ever
// landed here); the Vivi cEDH deck the task also named was never imported.

	// left when the primitive registered (effects/misc.go,
	// GenericChoice -> effCharm) -- Tireless Provisioner and Torment of

	// change (rules/protection.go hexproofBlocksTarget, pinned in
	// rules/hexproof_test.go), so its two carriers -- Lotus Field and Tectonic
	// Split -- are deliberately absent here: they are fully supported now.
	// Shifting Woodland and Vesuva's api:Clone entries were deleted when
	// api:Clone was registered (effects/clone.go): the real card test
	// rules/clone_api_test.go's TestMirageMirrorBecomesACopyOfTargetCreature

	// Charm branch reaches `DB$ Phases | Defined$ Self`, and the real card
	// tests rules/phases_test.go (Talon Gates of Madara, Guardian of
