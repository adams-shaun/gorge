// rescue_pepper_potts_test.go pins the ConditionDefined$ Targeted gate on the
// real repo-deck carrier (avengers-assemble's Rescue, Pepper Potts): "return up
// to one other target artifact or creature you control to its owner's hand. If
// it was an artifact, put a +1/+1 counter on NICKNAME." Before the gate read
// the Targeted group it failed OPEN, so Rescue took the counter whatever it
// bounced -- a plain creature, or nothing at all. That fix is what moved the
// botbench constructed-default golden (ticket agent-20260918T210307Z-25a7b039).
