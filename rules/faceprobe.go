// faceprobe.go: pricing an alternate-face cast offer AS the face it casts.
//
// Every alternate-face cast route (adventure_alt, adventure_recast, room_alt,
// split_alt, aftermath) is consumed by beginCast, which emits a FlipFace to
// the chosen face BEFORE the ordinary cast transaction. From that point on
// every cost reader -- the CR 601.2f cost-modifier gates (a RaiseCost's
// ValidCard$ Card.nonCreature, a ValidSpell$ type/cmc/colour read), the
// commander tax, the card's own self statics -- sees the FLIPPED face,
// because o.Face() is Faces[FaceIdx].
//
// The offer walk used to price those routes with the flipped face's printed
// cost but the object still showing its CURRENT face, so every modifier that
// reads the card's characteristics matched the wrong face. Measured: an
// Adventure creature in hand (Order of Midnight // Alter Fate) under Thalia,
// Guardian of Thraben's "noncreature spells cost {1} more" was offered its
// Alter Fate cast at {1}{B} (the Creature front is not taxed), and the cast
// flow -- reading the flipped Sorcery face -- charged {2}{B}, found it
// unpayable and reversed it (CR 733.1). Nothing changed, so the same offer
// came back and the bot picked it forever (a botbench livelock).
//
// offerAsFace answers the offer question the way the cast will: it points
// the object at the face the cast flips to for the duration of fn and puts
// it back before returning. This is a scoped READ, not a state change: the
// offer walk is a pure read (it emits no event), nothing can observe the
// probed face after the call, and the face the object shows afterwards is
// byte-identical to before -- so the log, the hash chain and replay are
// untouched. The walk's Derived memo (derivedmemo.go) is keyed on the board
// and would otherwise serve (or record) this object's characteristics under
// the wrong face, so it is bypassed for the probe; if anything inside fn
// opened a fresh memo generation, the walk's generation is bumped again on
// the way out so no probed-face entry is ever served after the restore.
