// A resolving ability that returns several lands at once, each of which meets
// a non-commuting entry competition (Horizon Explorer's enters-untapped body
// against the land's own enters-tapped body), parks one CR 616.1 order ask per
// land on the replChoices queue and suspends its resolution on e.resume. When
// the body chosen for one land ASKS (a shock land's "pay 2 life or it enters
// tapped" UnlessCost) while later lands' competitions are still queued, that
// nested Engine.Ask overwrote e.resume with its own frame; once the nested
// answer completed, the suspended resolution's frame was gone, and the next
// order answer called resumeResolution(nil) -- the botbench panic
// (cavalry-charge vs pro-shaper, seed 7149: Lumra, Bellow of the Woods
// returning Overgrown Tomb, Mirrorpool, Spire Garden, ... under Horizon
// Explorer). The suspended resolution must survive the nested ask and resume
// exactly once, after the last queued competition is answered.

// returnLandsSrc is a Lumra-shaped test-local trigger host: whenever its
// controller draws, return every land card from their graveyard to the
// battlefield tapped, then gain 1 life -- the sub-ability that proves the
// suspended chain's continuation runs exactly once.
