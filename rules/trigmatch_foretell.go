// Foretell trigger mode.
//
// Mode$ Foretell: "Whenever a player foretells a card, ..." (CR 702.126b;
// Dream Devourer, the corpus's sole carrier at the pin -- measured
// `/usr/bin/grep -rlE 'T:Mode\$ Foretell' .cards/cardsfolder | wc -l` => 1).
//
// The foretell action's replayable provenance is a two-event sequence in
// payCast's foretell branch (rules/cast.go): a CastInfo stamped
// FlagForetold while the card is still IN ITS HAND, followed by the
// face-down hand->exile MoveZone. The matcher binds the trigger to the
// CastInfo -- the flag alone cannot bind it, because the LATER
// foretell-cost cast from exile (rules/cast.go's modeFlags "foretell_cast")
// stamps the same flag on ITS pay-time CastInfo, and casting a foretold
// card is not foretelling (CR 702.126a: the special action is the exile).
// What distinguishes the two is the card's zone at emit time: the action's
// CastInfo is emitted BEFORE any move, so the card is still in ZHand; the
// later cast's CastInfo is emitted after the up-front PutOnStack, so the
// card is on the stack. A second provenance shape exists -- an EFFECT's
// Foretold$ True designation (effects/zone.go's applyFaceDownMarker), which
// emits no CastInfo at all, only the exile MoveZone whose counter carries
// the designation -- and it matches the same mode. The action's own
// MoveZone (plain "exiled_with_face_down") must NOT match here: its event
// already fired the CastInfo arm, and matching it again would double-fire
// the trigger on every foretell.
//
// Split into its own trigmatch file so tickets touching different modes
// stop colliding on one file. Registration is at the bottom; a duplicate
// mode panics (registerTrigMatcher).
