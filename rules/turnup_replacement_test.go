// turnup_replacement_test.go — the "as this is turned face up" replacement
// class (R:Event$ TurnFaceUp, CR 614.1a with CR 708.6/702.36e) and the
// T:Mode$ TurnFaceUp trigger observed off the morph-family special action,
// task cli-20260924T031747Z-6d0658fc. Each corpus carrier proves, end to
// end:
//
//   - Hooded Hydra: its "As Hooded Hydra is turned face up, put five +1/+1
//     counters on it" replacement runs as the turn-up happens — the
//     permanent finishes face UP with exactly five P1/P1 counters (0/0 base
//   - 5 = 5/5), the turn-up was never prevented, and the game replays.
//   - Trail of Mystery: its "Whenever a permanent you control is turned
//     face up, if it's a creature, it gets +2/+2 until end of turn" trigger
//     observes the morph special action's single TurnFaceUp event exactly
//     once and pumps the turned-up creature (1/1 → 3/3).
//   - Karlov Watchdog: "Permanents your opponents control can't be turned
//     face up during your turn" is a live CantHappen turn-up replacement —
//     it makes the opponent's turn_face_up special action ILLEGAL while it
//     is that controller's turn (the option is not even offered), leaves
//     the opponent's own-turn turn-up alone, and the permanent still turns
//     up on the opponent's own turn and replays.
//
// The decks are compiled corpus cards only (no Forge script text is
