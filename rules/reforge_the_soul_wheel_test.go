// The whole-hand wheel (Discard Mode$ Hand) pinned end to end on the REAL
// corpus cards. Feedback fb-20260918T072140Z-4ca8e286 ("reforge the soul
// --played by my enemy... I never discarded my hand, now have like 12
// cards"): the pre-fix engine had no Mode$ Hand case in effDiscard, so the
// wheel fell into the default front-card arm, discarded ONE card per player,
// kept the rest of the hand, and drew seven — everyone ended up with
// old-hand + 7.
//
// The helpers come from search_library_test.go (searchTestRegistry,
// searchCorpusCard, searchMoveByName), cast_test.go (addMana, submitChoices,
// toMain1) and replacement_updated_test.go (passUntilStackEmpty) — all the
// same package. The deck is built from compiled corpus cards only, so no
// Forge script text is committed. Neither Reforge the Soul nor Windfall is
// in any legacy golden deck, so no chain head depends on these cards.
