// The cost:Mandatory regression pin (task costmand1). A census agent reported
// that ParseCost treated Forge's `Mandatory` cost head as an unknown token and
// substituted one generic mana of it, so a `Cost$ Mandatory Sac<1/CARDNAME>`
// trigger body (Colfenor's Urn's end-step ability) was priced {1} too high.
//
// The fix -- `rules/mana.go`'s explicit `Mandatory` case, a skip-the-token
// `continue` -- is already in at this build's HEAD; this file is the direct
// regression pin the report asked for, on the real corpus prevalence. It pins
// three halves:
//
//  1. ParseCost for every `Cost$ Mandatory ...` head the corpus actually
//     carries (a table, re-measured 2026-09-20: Sac 15, PayEnergy 8,
//     PayLife 3, tapXType 1, ExileFromGrave 1, Exile 1 -- 29 raw lines) parses
//     with Generic == 0 and no Unknown entry.
//
//  2. The real card's own script: Colfenor's Urn's `Cost$ Mandatory
//     Sac<1/CARDNAME>` end-step trigger charges the sacrifice (the Urn leaves
//     the battlefield for the graveyard) rather than a phantom generic mana.
//     The fixture carries the card's exact script inline (never a committed
//     .txt -- Forge scripts are GPL-3.0 and this repo is Apache-2.0); the
//     Urn is in no repo deck, so TestHeads is independent of it.
//
//  3. The same card's gate: the end-step trigger's intervening-if
//     (`CheckSVar$ X | SVarCompare$ GE3`, X reading `SVar:X:ExiledWith$Amount`)
//     must actually evaluate -- the trigger stays silent below the threshold
//     and fires at it. The count evaluator needed the ExiledWith ref (and the
//     Amount property) for this; see effects/count.go's refTargets.

// TestMandatoryCostHeadParsesWithoutGeneric is the ParseCost half: every
// Mandatory-prefixed cost shape measured in the corpus parses with a zero
// generic component and no Unknown token. Before the fix the Mandatory head
// fell through to ParseCost's unknown-token default, which substitutes one
// generic mana.
