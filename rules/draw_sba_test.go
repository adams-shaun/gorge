// Task fx27 — "drawCard runs state-based actions unconditionally, including
// mid-resolution".
//
// This file records the investigation of rules/engine.go drawCard and PINS
// the behaviour that makes it correct, so a future refactor that routes a
// mid-resolution draw through the state-based-action-bearing path fails
// loudly instead of silently moving when SBAs run.
//
// The engine intentionally has TWO draw paths:
//
//	e.drawCard -> effects.DrawFor + e.checkStateBased   (rules/engine.go:648)
//	              REACHED ONLY FROM a priority boundary:
//	                - the opening-hand deal       rules/engine.go:415
//	                - the London mulligan redraw  rules/mulligan.go:226
//	                - the turn draw step          rules/turn.go:361
//
//	effects.DrawFor via the Draw primitive              (effects/cardflow.go
//	effDraw, callable directly as rules/resolveAbility -> effects.Resolve)
//	              REACHED FROM the resolution of a card that says "draw a
//	              card" — and it does NOT call e.checkStateBased. That is
//	              the CR 704.4 guarantee: SBAs are checked only when a
//	              player would receive priority, never in the middle of a
//	              spell or ability resolving.
//
// So the unconditional e.checkStateBased() at engine.go:650 is NOT reachable
// from a resolution: the two paths share effects.DrawFor but not the SBA
// tail. The test below pins that CR 704.4 behaviour for the resolution draw:
// a lethal-damage creature must survive the draw and only die at the next
// priority boundary. It fails if the resolution draw path ever starts running
// state-based actions mid-resolution (family F20).
