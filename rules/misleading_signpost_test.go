// corpus regression for api:ChangeCombatants (task changecombat1): Misleading
// Signpost's real TrigChangeAttacker SA — "you may reselect which player ...
// target attacking creature is attacking" — must ask which DEFENDER the
// attacker is re-pointed at, and the answered choice must re-point
// state.Game's attack and unblock it.
//
// The trigger-matching half (the T: line's Phase$ Declare Attackers /
// ChangesZone gating) is a different primitive's job and is bypassed here the
// same way TestCommandeerChangesTargetAfterAnsweredChoice bypasses casting:
// the trigger wrapper is pushed and targeted directly, and everything from
// resolveTop's CR 608.2b target recheck through the Engine ask, the
// suspension, the "choice" resume and the state mutation is the real engine.
