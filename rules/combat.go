// Task 21: combat. CR 508-510 in miniature -- declare attackers, declare
// blockers, then damage -- plus the CR 514.2 cleanup that combat depends on
// and that nothing in this codebase implemented before now. The lethal-
// damage and Deathtouch state-based actions this file's own damage marking
// depends on were also added here by Task 21, as destroyLethalDamage, but
// moved to sba.go by Task 22 -- they are general state-based-action logic,
// not combat-specific, and now live alongside the rest of CR 704.
//
// M1's own simplifications, matching the brief this task was built from:
//   - Only the active player attacks. The defending player is a real, per-
//     attacker choice since Task m34: each attacking creature may be declared
//     against ANY one living opponent, independently (CR 506.2 / CR 903.14),
//     and the KAttackers decision offers one option per (attacker, defender)
//     pair -- decision.Option.Player carries the pair's defender, so widening
//     M1's single-fixed-defender simplification into the true choice was
//     additive, exactly as this comment always promised. The engine rejects
//     an intent that declares one creature against two defenders
//     (validateAttackers), and with a single opponent the pair list is one
//     option per attacker at that one defender, so a two-player game
//     observes exactly the M1 surface.
//   - Players receive priority after attackers and blockers are declared.
//     Combat damage remains an automatic step.
//   - An ordinary blocking creature may block only one attacker (CR 509.1a).
//     askBlockers still offers every individually legal (blocker, attacker)
//     pair, while validateBlockers rejects a declaration that chooses two
//     pairs for the same blocker. The build does not model any keyword or
//     capability that grants additional blocks; validateBlockers must account
//     for such a capability if one is added.
