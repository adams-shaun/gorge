// resolveFused resolves a Fuse cast (CR 702.101b): one spell whose two

// tail -- the CR 608.2b target recheck, the Resolve event, the Ascend
// blessing and the off-stack move -- but over both halves instead of the
// single Face().SpellAbility().
//
// The cast recorded both halves' targets as one flat list on the stack
// object (the two target stages in order) AND each stage's own slice in
// Engine.fuseTargets at payment. Each half resolves the targets chosen FOR
// IT: the stage slice, rechecked against its own ValidTgts spec through
// legalTargets (the CR 608.2b recheck). The scratch-absent fallback -- a
// stack COPY of a fused spell inherits the flat list but not the engine
// scratch -- re-derives the split from the flat list through the spec, the
// pre-slice behaviour, which mis-assigns a target a half's spec merely
// overlaps (Turn // Burn's Creature vs Any); a copy keeps the original's
// targets by the standing copy stand-in, so the fallback is the same
// disclosed narrowing as every other copy family.
// The spell fizzles only when EVERY declared target is now illegal (CR
// 608.2b's one-instance rule); a half that lost its target does as much as
// possible while the other still resolves.
//
// Narrowing fixed: when ANY half SUSPENDS on a mid-resolution ask (an asking
// primitive such as a discard or sacrifice choice), the resumed frame
// completes THAT half through the ordinary resume machinery, and the
// still-unrun halves are chained after it as a fuse-rest continuation
// (resumeResolution's rp.fuseAlt frame) carrying each remaining half's own
// CR 608.2b-filtered target slice -- so Down // Dirty's Dirty runs after the
// answered discard ask exactly as it would have without the suspension.
// A suspension on the LAST half chains no fuse-rest frame: nothing is left to
// run, and the generic completion is byte-identical because the asking
// frame's own fusedTargets binding (resumeResolution) supplies the half's
// targets and suppresses the spurious ValidTgts$ re-ask the empty tail was
// once believed necessary for (review round 3, MINOR 2 -- the tail was
// untested and redundant).
//
// It never writes the engine resume state itself (ruling T21-e, pinned by

//
//   - Each half of a split card is castable on its own (CR 709.4): a hand
//     card is offered both its front face's cast and, as "split_alt", its
//     alternate face's cast. Mode split_alt is consumed by beginCast exactly
//     like room_alt/adventure_alt -- one event-sourced FlipFace to the chosen
//     face before the ordinary cast transaction, so every downstream reader
//     (rawBaseCost, targets, resolution) sees the selected half.
//
//   - Fuse (CR 702.101b) lets the caster cast BOTH halves as ONE spell: mode
//     fuse pays the combined mana cost (each half's printed cost) and
//     resolves both halves' spell abilities in sequence. The cast is not a
//     face flip -- the object keeps FaceIdx 0 -- and the pay-time FlagFused
//     provenance is what rules/stack.go's resolution reader dispatches on.
//
// The split helpers are structural over any two-face Split card: they key on
// the card's AlternateMode and the faces' own keywords, never a card name.

// kw:Fuse is read directly by rules (legal.go's offer, cast.go's cost/flag,
// stack.go's resolution), the same way Kicker/Flashback are: it has no
// cards.expandKeywords expander. Registering it is the coverage census's
