// (Card.IsRemembered+Creature, a + AND or a , OR list) must never over-apply
// to a remembered object that fails the extra predicate. The mechanism is now
// the general filter's IsRemembered (the compound resolves faithfully through
// the object matcher with the registered remembered set bound), but the
// pinned behaviour is the same one F2 guarded: the remembered non-creature is
// NOT blocked, and a bare IsRemembered spec still blocks a remembered object
// of ANY type.

// predicate); the general filter now implements IsRemembered, so the static
// registers for real and applies exactly to the remembered objects that ALSO
// satisfy the extra predicate -- here the remembered Elf, a creature. A
// remembered object that FAILS the extra predicate is covered by
// TestCompoundRememberedRestrictionDoesNotOverapply above (the restriction
// that test registers directly cannot be produced by a corpus Pump target,
// which is creature-only). No corpus card reaches this shape, so it is purely
