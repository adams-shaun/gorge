// TestNoTargetDecisionOffersAnIllegalTarget is a general invariant, not a
// regression test for one card: across EVERY target decision raised by the
// acceptance games at every seat count, every option offered must be one the
// rules actually permit.
//
// It exists because that invariant was silently false. `askTarget` (which
// builds the offer) and `legalTargets` (which rechecks at resolution) are two
// separate implementations of the same rule kept in agreement by hand, and
// they drifted: a counterspell was offered as a target of ITSELF (CR 115.5),
// the bot dutifully picked it, and the spell countered itself into its own
// graveyard. Three of the eight counters in the 8-seat game did exactly that,
// and nothing in the suite noticed -- the two existing Counter tests set
// Targets directly and never went through askTarget at all.
//
// The narrow exclusion that fixed it is in, at both sites, and this test does
// not re-test it. What it pins is the PROPERTY that fix was one instance of:
// a seat, human or bot, must never be shown an action the rules forbid. An
// engine that offers an illegal option and relies on the chooser declining it
// has moved a rules obligation onto its clients, and a bot will always take it.
//
// The check is structural rather than card-specific on purpose, so the next
// divergence between the offer and the recheck fails HERE, on whatever card
// first exposes it, instead of being found by reading a game log.
