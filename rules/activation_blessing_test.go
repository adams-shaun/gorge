// `Activation$ Blessing` (task activation-blessing-gate, CR 702.131): the
// "Activate only if you have the city's blessing" activation condition.
// rules/legal.go's activationConditionOK previously failed closed on the
// Blessing token because the latch was untracked; the Ascend machinery
// (rules/ascend.go, state.Player.Blessing, events.BlessingChange) now
// maintains it, so the gate reads the same one-way bit the bare
// Condition$ Blessing gate and the Count$Blessing.<yes>.<no> branch head
// read. The pins below drive the REAL offer path on the real corpus carrier
// (Arch of Orazca) and grant the blessing through the REAL Ascend event path,
// so the gate is proven on the state it gates on, not a hand-set flag alone.
