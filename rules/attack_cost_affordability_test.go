// attackcost-affordability: the l2 review-round narrowing of the shared
// combatChargeAffordable read.
//
// A resolved zero is a free charge, not an unpriceable cost. On main a
// Count$/SVar combat price that resolved to 0 was skipped as a free pair; the
// fail-closed round initially classified it `unpriceable`, so the creature
// could not attack or block AT ALL -- a real regression on corpus cards whose
// counted resource is legitimately empty (Myr Prototype at 0 counters,
// Collective Restraint with 0 land types, Cowed by Wisdom with an empty hand).
//
// A multi-pip charge payable ONLY by mixing branches (one pip with colour, one
// with life) is admitted by the joint Cost{Generic, Phyrexian} reachability
// read but the all-or-nothing election cannot settle it, so the pair used to
// be offered, validated, and then silently committed nothing. The read is now
// narrowed to the branches the window CAN settle.
//
// These tests pin both directions at the charge resolver and end to end
// through the offer list, each asserting its own precondition.

// TestCombatPropResolvedZeroCountIsFree pins the resolver: a Count$ body that
// resolves to 0 with a valid SVar table is a priceable FREE charge, never
// `unpriceable`.
