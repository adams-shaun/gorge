// The DB$ AddPhase turn-walk tests for the shapes effects/addphase.go's
// multi-step resolution mints (ticket ap1: the multi-step-set half of the
// row, plus the two deliberate consumer behaviours the row called untested).
// effects/addphase_multistep_test.go owns the parse side; these drive the
// real step machinery through the spliced ranges and replay-check the log.
//
// Every fixture drives to turn 3 seat 0 (a turn-1 creature is summoning
// sick, and a combat with no eligible attacker poses no attackers ask --
// CR 508.1's forced empty declaration), so the ordinary combats these tests
// resume into pose a real attackers ask to stop at.
