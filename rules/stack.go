// CopySpellAbility's MayChooseTarget$ parameter, so an external copier
// (Mirari, Cloven Casting, a Storm or Replicate copy) grants the election
// even though its SA is not part of the copied spell's text.
//
// The ask preserves the copied spell's WHOLE target requirement, not just
// one slot: MayChooseTarget$ True is not restricted to one-target spells, so
// the decision's bounds come from the copy's own declaration through the
// SAME resolvedTargetBounds / oneEachTargetBounds pair askTarget and cast.go's
// targetAsk use (a two-target spell therefore accepts two picks, and a
// per-controller declaration keeps its Option.Group exclusivity). Every
// inherited target is offered first as a keep-current option -- ALWAYS, even
// when it is no longer legal, because choosing new targets is optional and a
// player who keeps an illegal target simply lets the copy fizzle per CR
// 608.2b (forcing a new target here would retarget a copy the player declined
// to change) -- so selecting the leading keep-current options reproduces
// "choose nothing new". The remaining options use the same legal-target
// census as casting. The election is one-shot: the answer records targets
// through recordChosenTargets, whose TargetsChosen fold clears the flag, so
// the resolveTop re-entry does not ask again.
//
// A copy whose spell has MORE THAN ONE target DECLARATION -- the two halves
// of a Fuse cast, or each target-bearing mode of a modal spell -- is asked
// ONE DECISION PER DECLARATION, in the same
// order the cast asked them (castStageSA / castHasNextTargetStage), so each
// declaration is offered its own legal set, its own bounds and its own
// per-controller Option.Group. The earlier single-list shape flattened every
// declaration into one pool, so a half's own ValidTgts$ was never applied to
// its half's choices (a fused Wear // Tear offered only artifacts and never
// the enchantment the alternate half demands). A copy inherits the cast's
// announcement and target provenance; an illegal inherited target remains
// in its original declaration rather than migrating to a later stage. The
