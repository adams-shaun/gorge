// saga.go implements the Saga mechanic (CR 702.151, Forge's kw:Chapter; 236
// corpus files carry the keyword). A Saga is an enchantment whose chapter
// list (K:Chapter:<N>:<svar1>,...,...) names one sub-ability per chapter:
//
//   - It enters with ONE lore counter (granted inside events.Move, the same
//     every-entry-site convention the planeswalker starting loyalty uses, so
//     a search putting a Saga onto the battlefield is covered too).
//   - After its controller's draw step (rules/turn.go's draw-step entry) it
//     adds another.
//   - Each lore counter triggers the chapter ability of that number: the
//     counter-th SVar in the chapter list, queued as a delayed-shape trigger
//     (the mint path a Mode$ Phase delayed trigger uses -- the ability is an
//     SVar body, not a face Triggers index, so TriggerPush cannot carry it)
//     and resolved as an ordinary triggered ability.
//   - Once it carries its final chapter counter and that chapter ability has
//     left the stack, it is sacrificed (rules/sba.go's checkSagas -- the
//     CR 704.5v state-based action).
//
// Determinism: the chapter SVar list is the keyword parameter's own left-to-
// right order (cards.SagaChapters, the one parser both sides read); the
// trigger queue is the ordinary APNAP drain, so a chapter ability placed by a
// draw-step counter lands before any player priority exactly like every other
// turn-based trigger.

// chapterSpec is cards.SagaChapters, renamed locally so call sites read the
// same way the other keyword helpers here do.

// Saga (or the parameter does not parse).

// advanceSagas adds one lore counter to every Saga p controls (CR 702.151a's
// "after your draw step" half). One CounterChange event per Saga, in
// battlefield order, so the chapter triggers queue in the same deterministic
// order.

// checkChapterTriggers queues one chapter trigger per lore counter the event
// just placed. Called for exactly two events: a MoveZone onto the battlefield
// (the ETB lore counter events.Move grants -- the live counter read below
// already includes it) and a CounterChange on the LORE counter kind (the
// draw-step counter). A CounterChange carrying MORE than one counter (a
// Storyweave-style CounterNum$ 2 or Terra's CounterNum$ 3) crosses several
// chapter thresholds at once, so EVERY newly crossed chapter is queued, in
// ascending order -- CR 702.151b's "each chapter ability triggers when its
// chapter number is reached" is per counter, not per event; queueing only the
// final count's chapter would silently skip the crossed ones. The first
// chapter crossed is the count the object had BEFORE the event: the folded
// count minus the event's own Amount (the live counter read below already
// includes it), floored at 1 -- a MoveZone's entry grant starts from chapter
// 1 by construction. A count beyond the final chapter queues nothing past the
// last chapter (the overflow is the SBA's business, not a chapter ability's).
// The queue entry is the delayed-shape pendingTrigger: DelayedID -1 encodes
// "no registration to remove" (every real registration's ID is a monotonic
// uint32 from DelayedNext, so no DelayedPush this build can mint ever removes
// a real registration by accident), Execute names the chapter SVar, and the
// ability resolves out of the source face's SVar table at push time
// (events.Apply's DelayedPush case).
