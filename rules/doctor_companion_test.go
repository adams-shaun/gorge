// companion (real corpus Rose Tyler) and the other being a Doctor (real
// corpus The Tenth Doctor) is a legal pair, so the engine seats BOTH as seat
// 0's commanders in the command zone and each is castable from there. The
// companion half is deliberately NOT a Doctor itself (Rose Tyler is Human),
// so a seat that required the companion to carry the subtype would seat
// nothing.
//
// This is the deck-layer pair predicate read through the engine's own seating
