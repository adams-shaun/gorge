// The R:Event$ Scry replacement class (task scryrepl). The corpus carries
// exactly two carriers at the pin:
//
//   - Kenessos, Priest of Thassa: "If you would scry a number of cards, scry
//     that many cards plus one instead."  DB$ ReplaceEffect | VarName$ Num |
//     VarValue$ X, SVar:X ReplaceCount$Num/Plus.1
//   - Eligeth, Crossroads Augur: "If you would scry a number of cards, draw
//     that many cards instead."  DB$ Draw | Defined$ You | NumCards$ X,
//     SVar:X ReplaceCount$Num
//
// (/usr/bin/grep -rlE 'R:Event\$ Scry' .cards/cardsfolder -> 2 files.)
//
// The replacement is applied at the INSTRUCTION boundary, before any card is
// looked at (CR 614.4), which is why Host.Scry proposes the count and the
// completed events.Scry record (the bottom-card marker trig:Scry matches) is
// emitted afterwards, outside the replacement pass.

// scryUnimplementedNotes returns the loud "unimplemented Scry replacement"
// Notes in the log. A test that expects a replacement to have worked asserts
// this is empty, so a body falling to the fail-loud arm cannot pass as
// "nothing happens".
