// Findings-sol5 stack-path siblings: the committed direct-arm probe
// (life_draw_dredge_test.go) answers the parked GainLife→Draw dredge asks
// while the stack is EMPTY, so it exercises only handleModes' direct arm.
// The review round proved two further defects that live ONLY in
// resumeResolution's parked-frame arm -- a resolving spell on the stack:
//
//   - the FINAL parked draw of the body (lifeDraws == 0, i.e. the draw that
//     asked was the last one) had its answer silently dropped -- neither
//     applyDredge nor resumeOrdinaryDraw ran, and the flow fell into the
//     misleading "mid-resolution answer resumed with no sub-ability
//     recorded" Note; and
//   - every re-park early return discarded the interrupted resolution's
//     continuation chain (the new pending point is built bare, outer nil,
//     and rp.outer was never attached), so after the cascade completed the
//     object was finished without ever running the sub-ability that
//     followed the GainLife.
//
// The probe is on real card scripts: Nefarious Lich on the battlefield
// ("If you would gain life, draw that many cards instead"), Kiss of the
// Amesha resolving on the stack (SP$ GainLife 7 | SubAbility$ DBDraw, draw
// 2) targeting its caster, and a Golgari Thug (Dredge 4) in the graveyard.
// Seven life draws each pose their own dredge ask; the card's answer is
// 7+2=9 Draw events and Kiss in its owner's graveyard.
