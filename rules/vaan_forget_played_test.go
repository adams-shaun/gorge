// The ForgetPlayed$ pin (task param:api:Play.ForgetPlayed) on Vaan, Street
// Thief's REAL compiled corpus script. Vaan's combat-damage trigger digs the
// top card of the damaged player's library to exile, remembers it, and
// chains DB$ Play | Defined$ Remembered | ValidSA$ Spell | Optional$ True |
// ForgetPlayed$ True followed by DB$ Token gated on ConditionDefined$
// Remembered | ConditionPresent$ Card | ConditionCompare$ GT0 — the "you may
// cast it. If you don't, create a Treasure token." oracle. Before the fix
// the played card stayed in the remembered set, so the Treasure gate passed
// even when the cast was taken: a player who took the free cast also got the
// Treasure. The fix reads ForgetPlayed$ at effPlay's PlayDone re-entry
// branch and drops the played card from BOTH remembered halves through the
// one shared forget body (effects.forgetRememberedOne, the ForgetChanged$
// machinery — the same "forget-remembered" Choose event, no new event kind).
//
// Boundaries recorded:
//   - The DECLINE path needs no forget and keeps none: an empty answer
//     leaves ctx.Play at 0, so the guard `id != 0` never fires and the
//     Treasure is created exactly when nothing was played (the second test).
//   - The R-9 no-host branch (bottom of effPlay: a fuzz/no-engine host
//     "plays" the first candidate without beginning any cast) is deliberately
//     LEFT UNTOUCHED: no cast was begun there, the card never moves, and the
//     pre-existing stand-in divergence is not this ticket's business; a
//     forget on that path would also move fuzz-only event streams.
//   - An Amount$ Play that begins SEVERAL cards would only forget the first
//     (ctx.Play holds one card) — measured corpus-unreachable: every
//     ForgetPlayed$ carrier (19 files) plays exactly one card.
//
// Vaan, Street Thief is in NO repo deck and NO legacy golden deck (measured:
// grepping the 19 ForgetPlayed carrier names against
// internal/testutil/decks/*.json returns nothing), so no chain head depends
// on this card and TestHeads is safe by construction.
//
// The helpers come from search_library_test.go (same package): the deck is
// built from compiled corpus cards only, so no Forge script text is
// committed here either. The attack/damage half follows
// combat_damage_trigger_test.go's pattern.

// vaanEngine deals seat 0 Vaan (on the battlefield by turn 3) and seats
// seat 1 a deck whose single non-mountain card is a Grizzly Bears parked at
// the TOP of its library — the card Vaan's Dig exiles. The Bears is a
// target-free vanilla creature, so the answered play's cast ({1}{G}, paid
// from a raw ManaAdd pool) commits synchronously inside the resume arm.
