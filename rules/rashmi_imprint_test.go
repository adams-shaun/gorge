// The imprintplayed end-to-end pin on Rashmi and Ragavan's REAL compiled
// corpus card: the first-spell trigger exiles the top card of an opponent's
// library and offers its free cast (`ValidSA$ Spell.cmcLTX` — the bound is
// the artifacts-you-control X). The `ImprintPlayed$ True` marker records
// each card the Play actually begins to play on the source's imprint list,
// and the chained `ConditionDefined$ Imprinted | ConditionPresent$ Card |
// ConditionCompare$ EQ0` gate on DBEffect reads that list to pick the arm:
//
//   - the card WAS cast (imprinted): DBEffect is denied — no MayPlay static,
//     so the exiled card is not offered a second, mana-costed cast;
//   - the Play was DECLINED (nothing imprinted): DBEffect registers the
//     STPlay "you may play the exiled card" static, and the fall-back
//     mana-costed cast from exile is offered — the oracle's "If you don't
//     cast it this way, you may cast it this turn".
//
// Before this task the gate was unresolved (the sub ran unconditionally) and
// the imprint was never recorded, so BOTH branches registered the static.
// Rashmi and Ragavan is in NO repo deck and NO legacy golden deck, so no
// chain head depends on this card (measured: grepping the carrier names
// against internal/testutil/decks/*.json returns nothing).

// rashmiTestEngine builds a 2-seat game with Rashmi and Ragavan plus a Sol
// Ring on seat 0's battlefield, an Ornithopter in seat 0's hand (the spell
// that trips the first-cast trigger), and the opponent's library topped with
// an Ornithopter (the exiled card; cmc 0 < the one artifact, so the free
// cast is offered). It returns the engine, config, Rashmi's id and the
// exiled opponent Ornithopter's id.
