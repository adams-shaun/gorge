// The overlap re-base path for the TRIGGER form of api:Clone GainThisAbility$
// (ticket agent-20260923T090459Z-a4d7eb3b): when a clone unit expires while a
// surviving unit whose root is a TRIGGER remains on the same permanent,
// settleExpiredClones must re-emit the survivor as Counter
// "gain-this-trigger" with its one-based trigger index, not the ability form
// (which would append a wrong/none ability). No corpus carrier stacks two
// clone units on one permanent, so this registers the two markers directly --
// the machinery, not a card route.
