// while beginCast folded the additional sacrifice in afterwards. Village Rites
// was therefore offered to a player holding {B} and no creature; sacAsk found
// no candidates and aborted the cast. The abort is correct and consumes
// nothing -- which is exactly what made it unbounded: priority returned to the
// same board that produced the offer, so the option came back, was taken, and
// aborted again forever. A real 4-player game sat on turn 3 emitting the same
// five events until it was killed.
//
// The oracle is about the OFFER, not the abort: an option that cannot be paid
// must never be offered (CR 601.2b -- you announce a spell only if you can
// take every step, and 601.2f-h price and pay the total cost, additional costs

// again and aborts again, forever -- which is what a live 4-player game did on
// turn 3 until it was killed. The engine already has the answer for this
// (suppressedCast: hold the option out for the rest of the priority window,
// lift it on the first state-changing event -- see cast_liveness_test.go for
// the Delve decline), but this abort site hand-rolled its teardown and never
// engaged it. Ruling F05-2 (CR 733.2) delays the hold-out to the SECOND
// identical no-progress abort, so a single abort leaves the option offered as
// a legal retry.
