// testBot drives the rules package's own fuzz and acceptance harnesses with
// the same policy seat.Bot uses, through the same botpolicy.Decide (Ruling
// F7). Before botpolicy existed, this file carried a line-for-line copy of
// seat/bot.go's botDecide and clamp -- rules/fuzz_test.go is package rules,
// and importing seat -- which imports view -- runs the declared dependency
// order (cards -> state -> decision -> events -> effects -> rules -> view
// -> seat -> replay -> cmd/*) backwards into the package under test. There
// is one policy now, in botpolicy, and this file is its game-shaped
// adapter: answer builds the botpolicy.Board straight off the engine
// (botpolicy.BoardFromGame, the same facts a seat.Bot would build from the
// projected View, IsMain from e.G.Step.IsMain). seat/integration_test.go's
// TestBotAdaptersAgree* pins the two halves to the same Board for the same
// game facts.

// answer is the fuzz-driver interface this package's callers have always
// used: the call shape is unchanged from the mirror it replaces, except
// that the Board is now built here from the engine itself rather than by
// the caller. The engine is the game-shaped analog of the projected View a
// seat.Bot builds its board from (botpolicy.BoardFromGame reads g and the
// engine's derived P/T/keywords; botpolicy.Decide's doc explains the
// equivalence), so seat/integration_test.go's TestBotAdaptersAgreeOverWholeGame
// can pin the two halves to the same Board for the same game facts. The
// policy behaviour itself -- and its doc, per case -- lives in
// botpolicy.Decide; see there for the rationale of each decision.Kind.
// Every access into d.Options is guarded against the list being empty
// there, and clamp (Ruling T25-c) is the last thing every return does, so
// the intent this forwards always validates against d for any Min/Max the
// wire format allows, not only today's shapes.

// TestTestBotDelegatesToBotPolicy pins answer's wiring: for representative
// shapes of the decisions the fuzz gate throws at it, answer must deliver
// exactly what botpolicy.Decide would -- same Board (built from the same
// engine), same rng stream, same consumption points. A real engine
// supplies the Board because answer now derives it from the engine itself;
// the decision shapes are synthetic on purpose, so the test exercises the
// forwarding, not the game. This is the successor of the mirror tests
// (TestTestBotChoosePolicy and friends), which died with the mirror: the
// policy's behaviour is now tested once, in botpolicy/combat_test.go and
// policy_test.go, and this file only has to prove it forwards unchanged.
