// -- "search your library for a land card with a basic land type, reveal it,
// put it into your hand, then shuffle". Before the predicate was read, the
// filter matched nothing on every run (a legitimate-looking fail-to-find) so
// the ability silently did nothing.
//
// The test proves both directions:
//
//   - kicked: the search ask is posed and offers the basic-typed lands
//     (Forest, Mountain) while excluding a Wasteland (a Land with NO basic
//     land type -- CR 205.3i), and the answered pick moves to hand.
//   - unkicked: the trigger never fires, so no search ask is posed.
