// The batch-amount shape of Mode$ CounterAdded (the row's "CounterAdded models
// only the crossing gate, not the batch amount").
//
// counterAddedMatches already fires on the CounterChange put and already reads
// the event's whole placement batch for its crossing gate (CounterAmount$).
// What a plain CounterAdded trigger had no way to read was the batch itself:
// triggerReferents bound TriggerAmount/TriggerCard for CounterAddedOnce but
// not for CounterAdded, so a body written "put/draw that many" resolved
// TriggerCount$Amount to 0. Both modes share the one matcher, so both must
// bind the one batch role.
//
// TestCounterAddedBatchAmountReferentOnRealCard pins the binding on the real
// corpus CounterAdded card Bloodcrazed Hoplite (the row's "whenever a +1/+1
// counter is put on CARDNAME" shape). TestCounterAddedBatchAmountIsReadByTheBody
// drives the same mode end to end through the trigger queue and a body that
// reads TriggerCount$Amount, so the fix is proven at the resolution a player
// actually sees, not only at the referent.
