// Tests for the M2d-3 "concede" priority option (controller R-M3). The shape
// is the least new surface that satisfies the determinism constraints: a
// "concede" option served last on every priority decision whose taken path
// emits the EXISTING PlayerLost event with Text "conceded" (CR 104.3a) --
// no new event kind, no Registry method, no mutation outside events.Apply.
// PlayerLost's Apply marks the seat Lost, the state-based sweep removes its
// permanents, and checkGameOver ends the game with the last remaining seat
// the winner (CR 104.2a) -- exactly the life-loss path, which is the point.
//
// Scope (R-M3, consciously): a seat can concede only when it holds the
// engine's one decision path that offers the option -- its own priority
// decision. There is no off-priority concede in this build; a forged intent
// against a decision the seat does not hold is rejected by Validate.
