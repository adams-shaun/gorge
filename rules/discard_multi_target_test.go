// per-target cursor: a TgtChoose discard whose acting-player list holds TWO
// players (`Defined$ You & Opponent` — caster seat 0, opponent seat 1) must
// ask each one in order, and each answer must be applied to the target that
// gave it. The pre-fix walk consumed every resume's answer at target 0's
// cursor (DiscardTarget was never threaded from the resume point), so target
// 0's answer was re-applied to a hand that never held target 1's cards and
// target 1 was re-asked forever — targets 2..n were abandoned.
