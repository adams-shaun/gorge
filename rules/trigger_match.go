//
// The one acceptance-game behaviour this trailing entry actually changes is

// fallback conflated: the genuinely-complementary halves it was built for
// (Wooden Stake's blocks-or-is-blocked-by pair, Sower of Discord's two
// DamageDoneOnce halves, the Clashed Won$ True/False pairs) have disjoint
// Valid halves and never double-fire without a yield, while the pairs that
// DO co-fire on one event -- Zoraline's two Attacks triggers, Sephiroth's
// printed attack trigger beside its marked "enters or attacks" half,
