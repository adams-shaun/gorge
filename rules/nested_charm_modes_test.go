// TestNestedCharmDoesNotInheritOuterModes pins the fx41 defect: a Charm whose
// chosen mode's sub-chain reaches a SECOND Charm must pose its own modal ask.
//
// THE SHAPE IS CORPUS-UNREACHABLE TODAY. A walker over the compiled corpus
// (cards.OpenCorpus on .cards/ir.gob.gz at the branch under test) counted
// 797 distinct compiled Charm SAs; resolving every Charm's Choices$ name
// through cards.ResolveSVar and walking each returned sub-chain, ZERO Charm
// SAs reach a second Charm. So this is a latent landmine, not a live defect:
// the engine authors already knew it (the depth-3 test in
// resumption_after_ask_test.go deliberately used a Repeat, not a second Charm,
// as its two-level carrier, because "a Charm invoked AS a mode inherits that
// Modes value and re-resolves itself endlessly"). The fixture below
// reproduces the shape so a future card or script change cannot re-open it
// silently.
//
// The card: an outer Charm whose own SubAbility$ is a second Charm.
//
//	A:SP$ Charm | Choices$ DoGain,DoLose | SubAbility$ InnerCharm
//
// On the outer Charm's resume pass, Ctx.Modes is set to the chosen outer
// mode's SVar name. The bug is that effCharm hands the SAME Ctx (with Modes
// still set) to every mode it runs AND to the Charm's own SubAbility$, so
// the inner Charm below reads c.Modes != nil, takes the re-entry branch, and
// "runs" the OUTER mode names against the INNER Charm's SVar table instead of
// posing its own choice. Here DoGain resolves (inside the inner Charm's
// table) to the same GainLife 5 SA, so the caster gains 5 a second time and
// the inner modal ask never fires. Correct resolution: the outer mode runs
// once (+5), then the inner Charm poses its own KModes decision.
