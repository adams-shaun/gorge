// MayPlay statics carrying RaiseCost$: the surcharge the permission adds on
// top of the printed cost (CR 118.3a) is now CONSUMED on the rules/mayplay.go
// route, instead of failing the whole static closed. Kotis, Sibsig Champion
// is the pinned carrier: "Once during each of your turns, you may cast a
// creature spell from your graveyard by exiling three other cards from your
// graveyard in addition to paying its other costs."
//
// A raise ParseCost cannot price (the variable forms -- a bare X, an
// announced PayLife<X>, an unknown token) still fails the static closed: the
// card is withheld whole, never granted with an uncharged surcharge. Risen
// Executioner's `RaiseCost$ X` is the pinned trap (a bare X parses to c.X++,
// which costAnnouncesCastX catches).
