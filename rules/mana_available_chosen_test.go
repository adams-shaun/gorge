// The available-mana projection must read the source's RECORDED as-enters
// choice before parsing its Produced$ value. A "Combo R Chosen" permanent
// (a thriving/gate land: "Add {R} or one mana of the chosen color") reports
// its real possibilities only after the recorded ChosenColor is substituted
// into the Chosen token; feeding the raw value to ProducedCounts advertised
// all five colours, so the seat rail claimed a green pip the source cannot
// actually produce. The substitution is the same read the activation path
// performs (substituteChosenProduced), now applied in addAvailable too.

// differing G recorded it offers R and G, and neither reports the other three
// colours. Both branches are asserted so a hard-coded colour cannot satisfy it.
