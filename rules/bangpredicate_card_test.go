// TestBangPredicateUnlocksTargeting is the gameplay-visible leaf for the
// leading-'!' negation grammar: a real corpus card whose printed behaviour
// was broken when `Creature.!attacking+!blocking` matched NOTHING.
//
// Unlikely Alliance reads:
//
//	{1}{W}: Target nonattacking, nonblocking creature gets +0/+2 until end of
//	turn.
//
// Its compiled ability is `A:AB$ Pump | Cost$ 1 W | ValidTgts$
// Creature.!attacking+!blocking`. With '!' unrecognised (it was only a
// literal character inside the one hand-written "!token" map entry), both
// predicates matched NOTHING, so the ability had zero legal targets and was
// withheld entirely -- "{1}{W}: target a nonattacking, nonblocking creature"
// could never be activated. With the negation implemented, the ability is
// offered and offers exactly the creature that is neither attacking nor
// blocking; the attacking Bear and the source enchantment must never be
// offered.
