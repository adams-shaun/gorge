// The Count$ head ratchet (the 2026-09-22 repo-deck audit's follow-up): the
// primitive-coverage ratchet (acceptance_test.go's knownUnsupported) only
// asks the registry whether each PRIMITIVE is registered, and the parameter
// census (paramcensus_test.go) only asks whether each PARAMETER is read. A
// Count$ head that is neither a parameter nor a primitive can sit inside a
// fully-registered card and still evaluate to nothing: Cabal Ritual's
// `SVar:X:Count$Threshold.5.3` made the ritual add NO mana and Aspect of
// Hydra's `SVar:X:Count$Devotion.Green` pumped +0/+0, both while their
// primitives (api:Mana, api:Pump) were registered and their Amount$/NumAtt$
// parameters "read". This ratchet closes that blind spot:
//
//   - it walks every repo-deck card's (all 26 deck files, both the 12 pinned
//     Legacy constructed decks and the Commander decks) face SVar bodies
//     that begin with `Count$` through effects.EvalCountOK — the same
//     verdict the SVar-condition gates consume — and fails on any body that
//     comes back UNRESOLVABLE, which is exactly "no head in the dispatch
//     matched".
//   - knownUnmodelledCountHeads is the seeded baseline over the current repo
//     decks, checked in both directions exactly like knownUnsupported: a
//     body the engine newly cannot resolve is a regression; a table entry
//     the build now resolves is stale and must be deleted. It only ever
//     shrinks, and only when a real card test proves the head resolves.
//   - the host is a live two-seat engine and the Ctx a bare
//     {Controller: 0, Source: 0}: the verdict this ratchet holds must not
//     depend on a resolution in flight. Count$ChosenNumber is the one table
//     entry whose (0, false) is a RUNTIME binding verdict, not an unmodelled
//     head (rules seeds Ctx.ChosenNumberBound for effect-created
//     replacement bodies; wildgrowth1) — it stays in the table with its own
//     comment until a bound-context read changes its unbound verdict.
