// This file owns the face-aware plumbing for a MUTATED pile (CR 702.140d).
// state.Object's PileAbilityCount/At, PileFaceCount/At and PileStaticCount/At
// give the one flat view of a permanent's rules text (index-based, because
// every one of those walks runs per object per legal-actions pass and the
// repo's allocation budgets forbid a per-object slice); these helpers thread the owning face's SVar table
// through the rules-side reads that used to assume the top face, and resolve a
// pendingCast's flat ability index back to its SA and owning face.
//
// The merged ordinal convention is state's: 0 is the top face, i+1 is the i-th
// under-card.

// pileSVars returns the SVar table a pile position resolves against, with any
// AddSVar$ grant layered under the printed table (the same precedence
// sVarGateOK documents: a printed SVar of the same name wins). merged 0 is the
// top face, so every non-mutated read is unchanged -- grantedSVarsFor is only
// consulted for the top face, exactly as before.

//
// The grantor may itself be a mutated pile whose GRANTING STATIC sits on an
// under-card (CR 702.140d): the named body then lives on that under-card's own
// SVar table, which is exactly where the offer side reads it -- legal.go's
// grantedAbilities resolves the name against the emitting
// ContinuousEffect.SVars, and rules/layers.go stamps a merged face's table
// onto the effects it emits. If the ACTIVATION side read only the grantor's
// active face, an option that was legally offered would resolve to nil and
// the activation would silently no-op. So the faces are walked in the pile's
// own deterministic order, top face first: a non-mutated grantor resolves
// byte-identically to the old Face().SVars read, and the first face that
// names the SVar with an AB body wins.
//
// Nothing here is an index decode: a granted activation carries ability == -1
// and is anchored by NAME, so the flat pile-ability index never applies to it.
