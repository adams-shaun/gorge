// Round-2 review regressions for CR 724 (the monarch) and Palace Jailer's
// command-zone return promise. Two defects the first round shipped:
//
//  1. Palace Jailer's `ValidPlayer$ Player.OpponentOf Remembered` was read as
//     "the new monarch controls the remembered exiled creature", which is the
//     wrong anchor. The relation is against the EFFECT's controller: seat 0's
//     Jailer exiles seat 1's creature, and ANY opponent of seat 0 (seat 2 in a
//     three-seat game) becoming the monarch must return it.
//  2. The synthetic monarch-draw DelayedPush carried Amount zero, which
//     events.Apply read as delayed-registration ID 0 and deleted -- dropping
//     the first unrelated delayed trigger whenever the monarch's draw went on
//     the stack.
