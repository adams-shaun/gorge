// CastableObjects counts the DISTINCT castable objects a priority decision

// ways (an alternative cost, a kicked mode), and those are the same choice of
// card.
//
// It is the ONE definition of "a decision with a real choice between casts"
// shared by the search teacher's eligibility (searchseat.CastOptions returns
// it) and the learned seat's priority gate (seat.PolicyNetBot scores a
// priority decision only when this is >= 2), so the distribution the policy
// head was trained on and the one it is asked to answer cannot drift apart.
// Pure over the decision's options; the set is only probed, never ranged.
