// Card is the casting half of the policy's picture of one object the
// deciding seat can legally see (its own hand, graveyard and battlefield):
// whether it is a creature, its derived power, its printed mana value, and
// whether it is a basic land. The facts are exactly the ones the casting
// rules below read, produced identically by boardFromView (off the
// projected CardViews the seat receives) and BoardFromGame (off
// state.Game), so a card the policy ranks means the same thing whichever
// host asked. Every field below is read by a rule branch, so none is
// untested surface: the set is the ones chooseCast (Creature, Power,
// CMC), chooseLand (Basic), the ability ranking (AttachedTo) and the tap
// gate (Castable, ManaCost, Produces, and the creature facts it shares
// with chooseCast) actually branch on. The obligation that both halves
// fill every field identically is enforced, not aspirational: the
// adapter-parity tests (seat/integration_test.go's
// TestBotAdaptersAgreeOverWholeGame and
// TestBotAdaptersAgreeOverCommanderGame) compare the two halves' Card
// maps with maps.Equal -- every field of botpolicy.Card, on every intent
// of two whole games -- so a field one half fills and the other leaves
// zero is caught. A new Card field must be filled on both halves or not
// added at all.
//
// Power is the engine's derived power (ch.Power), which for a card in a
// hand or graveyard is its printed power — no continuous effect applies to
// a card that is not on the battlefield. Reading it the same way on both
// halves is what keeps the adapter pair in step; a fact one half fills and
// the other leaves zero would be a bot that casts differently depending on
// who asked.

	// It comes straight from state.Object.AttachedTo (and the projected
	// CardView.AttachedTo, which is that same field) on the two adapter
	// halves, so A1's equip no-op detection (ability.go) judges a re-attach
	// identically whichever host asks. Only a battlefield permanent carries
	// a non-zero AttachedTo; a hand or graveyard card reads 0 on both
	// halves, which is what lets them stay a plain casting fact.
	AttachedTo state.ObjID
	// Activated is how many non-mana activated abilities this permanent was
	// activated for this turn (state.Object.ActivatedThisTurn via the
	// projected CardView.ActivatedThisTurn on the view half). A5's
	// repeatable-ability budget reads it: a source already activated this
	// many times is declined, which is what ends a tap-and-untap cycle
	// (Basalt Monolith's "{3}: Untap this artifact" re-enabling its own tap
	// forever) before the turn spins. Both halves fill it identically, so
	// the parity tests keep judging it.
	Activated int32
	// ManaCost is the printed cost in Forge notation ("1 W", "U U",
	// "X G") -- the same string both understanding halves already read for
	// CMC (CmcOf) and the View carries as CardView.ManaCost. The tap gate
	// (tap.go) re-parses it for the coloured-pip demands of the card it is
	// pricing, which is where a colour-blind tap policy would otherwise
	// float the wrong colour and stall against a multi-coloured cost.
	ManaCost string
	// Castable reports whether the deciding seat could cast this card from
	// where it currently sits, given enough mana: true for the seat's own
	// hand, for the command zone (this engine only ever puts commanders
	// there), and for the graveyard when the card has the Flashback
	// keyword; false for the battlefield (a permanent is already cast).
	// The tap gate reads it to restrict "a spell worth mana" to spells the
	// seat can actually cast -- a battlefield permanent never justifies a
	// tap. Both halves fill it from the same zone membership (the projected
	// zone lists; the engine's zone walk plus the derived keyword list), so
	// the gate sees the same castability whichever host asks.
	Castable bool
	// OnBattlefield reports whether this object is currently a permanent on
	// a battlefield (the deciding seat's own). It is the zone signal the
	// casting Card census carries but Castable does not: a graveyard card
	// is also not "castable" without Flashback, and a battlefield permanent
	// is never castable, so Castable alone cannot tell a live mana source
	// from a spent one. chooseLand (and the availability fold behind it)
	// reads OnBattlefield to know which cards are actually producing mana
	// on the battlefield, so a land drop is aimed at a colour the hand
	// still lacks rather than one a permanent already supplies. Both
	// adapter halves fill it from the same zone-membership source (the
	// projected battlefield list on the view half; the ZBattlefield zone
	// walk on the game half), so the two agree.
	OnBattlefield bool
	// InstantSpeed reports whether the card can be cast at instant speed:
	// it is an Instant, or it carries the Flash keyword (a permanent with
	// flash enters at instant speed, and an instant with flash is still an
	// instant). Both halves fill it from the same sources -- the projected
	// CardView.Types/Keywords on the view half, the face's Types and the
	// engine's derived keyword list on the game half -- so the mana reserve
	// (reserve()) prices the same hand whichever host asks. A battlefield
	// permanent that has neither is not instant-speed, which is what keeps
	// the reserve from counting a spell the seat has already cast.
	InstantSpeed bool
	// Produces is what this card's mana abilities add to the pool when a
	// tap-for-mana activation runs them (cards.ManaProduction, plain data
	// -- botpolicy must not import view or rules, Ruling F7). It is filled
	// by both adapter halves from the same source -- the projected
	// CardView.Produces on the view half, cards.Face.ManaProduction on the
	// game half -- so the tap heuristic reads the same production whichever
	// host asks. It lets chooseTap pick a source that produces a colour a cast
	// needs and spend the least flexible one first. It also describes a land
	// card while it is still in hand, and it is the fact the land-drop ranking
	// (chooseLand) reads to pick a land in the colour the hand still needs.
	Produces cards.ManaProduction
	// Counter reports whether this card's primary cast-shape ability (its
	// SP$ line) is a Counter -- i.e. casting it counters a spell. It is
	// filled by both adapter halves from the same printed face fact -- the
	// projected CardView.SpellAPI on the view half, the face's own
	// cards.Face.SpellAbility().API on the game half -- so a card is a
	// counter whichever host asked (pinned over a whole game by the
	// adapter-parity tests, non-vacuously over a counterspell-vs-creature
	// mirror). The casting rule (C8) reads it: a counter is only worth its
	// mana at a stack holding a FOREIGN spell, never at an own-spells-only
	// (or empty) stack, where casting it would spend mana to counter the
	// caster's own play. A card whose counter lives on an AB/trigger line
	// rather than its SP$ line (Mausoleum Wanderer) is NOT a counter here,
	// and is out of the cast-side rule's scope by design -- those route
	// through the ability/trigger paths, not chooseCast.
	Counter bool
	// Toughness is the engine's derived toughness (ch.Toughness), the
	// creature body's other half. It is a cast-scorer feature only -- the
	// CreatureToughness weight in castScore -- never part of the shared base
	// worth (cardWorth), so the discard and commander-zone paths keep
	// pricing a creature by power alone. Per this doc comment's parity
	// obligation above, both adapter halves fill it from the same derived
	// source -- the projected CardView.Toughness on the view half,
	// ch.Toughness(id) on the game half -- so the adapter-parity tests judge
	// it on every intent of a whole game.
	Toughness int32
	// Tapped reports whether this battlefield permanent is currently tapped
	// sideways. It exists for one reader: the cast scorer's CurveFit feature
	// counts the seat's producible mana over its UNTAPPED battlefield
	// sources (producibleMana), so a tapped source must not promise mana
	// this turn. Like every Card field it is filled identically on both
	// adapter halves -- cv.Tapped on the view half, o.Tapped on the game

// chooseCast is the KPriority cast ranking: it picks ONE of the offered

// stated for what it reads:
//
//   - C1 (board over one-shots): a creature outranks a non-creature. A
//     creature is the only card type that attacks, and therefore deals
//     damage, every turn; casting one adds a permanent source of damage —
//     the fast path to ending the game. A one-shot (burn/removal) removes
//     one thing or deals damage once and is done. With the effect unread,
//     a creature is the choice that moves the game toward a finish.
//   - C2 (more imminent damage): among creatures, the higher power wins —
//     the more damage it will deal the next time it attacks, and every
//     time after.
//   - C3 (bigger effect): among non-creatures, the higher mana value wins
//     — the printed cost the bot is spending, its best guess at the bigger
//     effect when it cannot read effects.
//   - C4 (no alternative cost is an ordinary cast): a kicked/surged/
//     flashback/miracle "cast" option scores apart from an ordinary one
//     (see castScore), read off Option.Mode never the label.
//   - C5 (unreadable): an option whose Obj carries no board card facts
//     scores as a non-creature of mana value 0, a low rank, never a crash.
//   - CR1 (the command zone is taxed, CR 903.8): a "cast" whose Obj is a
//     commander currently sitting in its owner's command zone ranks as its
//     ordinary castScore minus CommanderTaxScale*Casts*CMC — the tax priced on
//     the commander's own mana value (see the commandTax comment), and
//     an option scoring below zero is NOT cast at all. The tax is per
//     prior cast, so the bot casts its commander while the recast is
//     still worth the mana it costs — a cheap commander is recast many
//     times (a 2/2, CMC 2, scores 38, 28, 18, 8 through its fourth cast
//     and refuses only the fifth), an expensive one is abandoned early (a
//     12/12, CMC 12, scores 78, 18 and refuses its third), and a
//     commander that keeps dying is not re-recruited forever. A commander
//     cast from the HAND scores as an ordinary card — NoTax (a hand cast
//     neither costs {2} nor counts), which is the whole reason the rule
//     is gated on InCommandZone and not on "is a commander". This price
//     is a value judgment on what the recast costs, NOT an affordability
//     check: the engine already refuses what the pool cannot pay
//     (rules/cast.go's commanderTaxFor gates the offer), so this is purely
//     "is the recast still worth bothering with". A command-zone cast is
//     also NOT subject to C9's hold threshold: CR1 prices it by value
//     alone and its own score-below-zero refusal is its only boundary,
//     because the deck must always be able to cast its commander.
//   - C9 (the hold threshold): after the loop, when the best surviving
//     option's final score is strictly below CastThreshold AND that best
//     option is NOT a command-zone cast, chooseCast returns -1 and the
//     priority rule (policy.go) falls through to the ability ranking and
//     the pass exactly as it does when nothing was castable. The
//     exemption is per WINNER, not per candidate: a command-zone cast is
//     exempt only while it is itself the best option — if a hand card
//     outscores it, the hand card is the best option and the threshold
//     applies to the whole decision. The default profile's threshold is
//     MinInt32/2, unreachable by the bound in the field's comment, so the
//     default bot never holds.
//   - C10 (interaction features): five per-option conjunctions of the
//     card's class with the decision context — CreaturePrecombat
//     (creature × FirstMain), CreatureOppCreatures and
//     NonCreatureOppCreatures (each class × the opponent creature count,
//     the latter the removal proxy), CreatureLifeDelta (creature ×
//     LifeDelta) and InstantSpeedOffTurnHold (instant-speed × the seat's
//     own main phase, the hold term that pairs with C9). All are weight 0
//     in the default profile, so the default arithmetic is unchanged.
//   - C6 (deterministic tie): ties break on option index, so no map
//     iteration order reaches the answer.
//   - C7 (the mana reserve, B2): the bot keeps the mana pool at or above the
//     cost of the cheapest instant-speed card it holds (an Instant, or a
//     permanent with Flash; reserve() is 0 when it holds none, making C7
//     inert) by PREFERRING a cast that leaves that reserve over a
//     comparable one that empties it -- the reserve is a score bonus a
//     reserve-keeping cast earns, so among equivalent cards the bot holds
//     mana for an instant-speed play, but a clearly better cast (a strong
//     creature, an unprotected commander) is still made even if it spends
//     the reserve. A hard block here made the bot decline casting its good
//     hands and sit on mana the phase threw away, so C7 is deliberately a
//     preference, not a refusal. A command-zone commander cast is priced by
//     value alone, never held for the reserve.
//   - C8 (a counter needs a foreign spell): a "cast" option whose Card is a
//     counter (Card.Counter — its SP$ ability is a Counter) is not cast at
//     all when the Board's stack census shows NO foreign spell — every
//     stack spell is the deciding seat's own, or the stack is empty.
//     Casting a counter then can only target the caster's own spell (the
//     commit point is HERE, before the mana is spent: once cast, the
//     target ask's Min-1 leaves no exit), so the wasted self-counter shape
//     — the bot spending {U}{U} to nuke its own Brainstorm — is refused
//     outright. A counter cast at a stack holding a foreign spell keeps
//     its ordinary score: countering an opponent's spell is exactly the
//     behaviour this rule exists to preserve, and in multiplayer a stack
//     spell by any other seat is foreign, so four-seat play keeps every
//     real target. The census is b.Stack, an ordered slice filled
//     identically by both adapter halves, so no map iteration order can
