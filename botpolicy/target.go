// threat is the policy's ranking of an opposing creature as the thing a
// targeting decision should hit. It deliberately answers "which of the
// opponent's creatures is most worth removing" rather than pitting a
// creature against the opponent's face -- that comparison is the calling
// code's business (faceScore below) -- and it reads only facts already on
// botpolicy.Creature, so neither adapter adds a Board field for it.
//
// The metric prices three things beyond power:
//
//   - persistence: remTough (Toughness minus accumulated damage) is counted,
//     so a healthy creature ranks above an identical one that is one hit
//     away from dying on its own -- removing the creature that will stick
//     around is worth more than one that dies anyway.
//   - availability: an untapped creature can block our incoming attack, so
//     it ranks above a tapped one that has already swung this turn and
//     cannot (CR 509.1).
//   - evasion: a keyword that makes the creature harder to answer with
//     ordinary damage or blocks -- Flying (hard to block, dodges ground
//     removal), Deathtouch (kills anything it trades into), First
//     Strike/Initiative (combat sentences), Vigilance (attacks and still
//     blocks), Reach (keeps the skies honest) -- each adds value a bare
//     power+toughness proxy would miss.
//
// Pure power would order a dying 4/1 above a woken 3/3; threat flips them,
// which is the whole reason the policy does not rank by Power alone.

// faceScore is what pointing a targetable-at-player effect at the
// opponent's face is worth on the PLAIN ranking path (rankOption), the one
// used when the KTarget decision carries no recognisable effect or no
// literal damage figure. It is a neutral constant, because on that path
// the policy cannot read the effect that produced the decision -- an
// absent target_effect, an unknown API, or a null/absent damage amount are
// all "the effect is unreadable", so it cannot tell a burn -- an effect
// that actually reduces a player's life -- from a draw or a removal whose
// effect never touches the face. With that fact absent, any bonus keyed on
// the opponent's life, their proximity to a lethal track's end, or their
// biggest creature would be a kill the policy cannot prove:
//
//   - a player at 2 life is no more a win than one at 18 when the effect
//     may deal no damage at all;
//   - "near" the 21 commander-damage clock is not burn reach: ordinary
//     non-combat spell damage never advances that clock (CR 903.10 counts
//     only the combat damage one commander has dealt), so it must not
//     attract face targeting;
//   - keying the score on the target's biggest creature can prefer the
//     healthier player in a multiplayer game.
//
// So on the plain path the face ranks neutrally, beneath every on-board
// creature threat, and is only chosen when no opposing creature is a legal
// target (a burn at a face, a drain, a life-gain that only targets players)
// or as a later pick in a multi-target decision. R2's board-over-face holds
// by construction: any creature ranks above it, so the face is never picked
// over a creature the policy cannot be sure the effect is better than.
// Ties among equal faces (the multiplayer case) break on option index (R7),
// the deterministic answer.
//
// When the effect IS readable (a known literal damage figure), the face is
// scored by effectRanker instead, and a face the damage reaches becomes the

// chooseTargets is the KTarget policy. It answers the one question the old

//
//   - R2' (the ft1 face-aiming tiers, when the effect is readable): when
//     the decision carries a known literal damage figure (effectDamage),
//     options are ranked by the three tiers of effectRanker instead of the
//     plain scale: an opponent creature that may kill the seat this round
//     and that the damage kills (tierThreat), then an opponent's face the
//     damage reaches lethally (tierFaceLethal), then the most powerful
//     creature the damage kills when there is spare mana (tierValue), and
//     everything else falls to the board-first ranking below. An unknown
//     effect, API or amount keeps the plain scale, where the face is
//     neutral -- an unknown is never treated as lethal or as a threat.
//   - R1 (never your own while an opponent exists): an option belonging to
//     the deciding seat is only ever chosen when every other option is also
//     theirs -- a self-target decision (a pump, an aura, a recursion that
//     offers only the seat's own board), which cannot help but point at
//     themselves. When any opposing option exists, the seat's own
//     permanents are never touched.
//   - R2 (board over face): the opponent's best battlefield creature is
//     always preferred over the opponent's face when one is a legal target.
//     The policy cannot read the effect that produced the decision, so it
//     cannot prove it reaches the player at all -- a burn and a draw read
//     identically -- which makes a face target a claim the policy cannot
//     support. So the face ranks neutrally (faceScore is a constant) below
//     every on-board creature threat, and a creature offered alongside it
//     is always the pick. A player target is chosen only when no opposing
//     creature is a legal target (a burn at a face, a drain, a life-gain
//     that only targets players), or as a later pick in a multi-target
//     decision.
//     R7 (deterministic neutral tie): equal faces -- the multiplayer case,
//     or a face beside a zero-fact option -- break on option index, so no
//     map iteration order reaches the answer.
//   - R3 (rank better than pt): opposing creatures rank by threat(), which
//     prices remTough, Tapped and evasion keywords on top of power, not by
//     a bare power or power+toughness figure.
//   - R4 (unreadable options): an option whose Obj is in no zone this Board
//     reads is a 0-score low rank, never a panic; it is only chosen when
//     every other option in its decision also ranks at or below it (the
//     all-off-board graveyard pick, say).
//   - R5 (honour Min/Max): exactly d.Min targets are picked when the
//     decision demands that many, up to d.Max; a may/up-to decision
//     (Min 0) fires its full legal width up to d.Max, so multi-target
//     removal does not idle half-efforts. The count is produced here, and
//     never left for clamp: clamp's top-up fills with lowest-index
//     options -- position order, the very thing this policy replaces -- so
//     an under-filled choice would reintroduce the positional bug by
//     another door.
//
// Like the combat branches, it consumes no rng: the pick is a pure function
// of the offered options and the board facts, and every tie breaks on
