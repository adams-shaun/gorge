// This file holds the trigger-order and trigger-optional rules the policy
// answers without any randomness. Before this task (dp1) those two kinds
// were a Fisher-Yates over the bot's rng (trigger_order) and a coin between
// yes and no (trigger_optional): two decisions that injected variance into
// every game and widened the very confidence intervals that make most deck
// pairs read as coin flips. The semantic content the policy needs -- which
// trigger, from what source, carrying what label -- is carried on the
// Decision's own options (each trigger option's Obj is the source permanent
// and its Label is the trigger's own text) and the source's board facts on
// the Board's Cards census, so neither rule needs a new Board field or a
// new plumbing path: it reads the same card-worth arithmetic the cast rule
// reads, from the same facts both adapter halves fill.

// chooseTriggerOrder is the KTriggerOrder ranking: a deterministic
// permutation of the offered trigger indices, ordered by the source card's
// worth (cardWorth — the same creature-power/mana-value arithmetic the cast
// rule reads), most valuable source first, ties on option index. It replaces
// the Fisher-Yates shuffle: the bot no longer randomises the order its
// own simultaneous triggers hit the stack, so the same game state always
// yields the same order (and the same replay), and the ordering reads the
// board facts available rather than gambling.
//
// DIRECTION, stated rather than hidden: Choices[0] is the trigger put on the
// stack first and so resolves last (CR 603.3b). Placing the most valuable
// source first puts it on the stack first and lets it resolve last, so the
// trigger the board says is worth the most sits on the stack longest; with
// the effects unreadable, this is a defensible consistency rule rather than
// a claimed interaction win. A perfect interaction-aware ranking is out of
// reach without reading the triggers' effects; the alternative to this rule
// was leaving a shuffle in place, which the task explicitly excludes.

// The KTriggerOptional rule is a deterministic accept, replacing the coin
// flip: an optional trigger is a "you may" the controller declines only when
// the effect is a net loss, and botpolicy cannot read the effect — it sees
// only the source's board facts and the card's own words in the label,
// neither of which says whether the trigger pays. The dominant class of
// optional trigger is a controller benefit (draw a card, put a counter,
// gain life, deal damage), and the engine separately handles the cases where
// the choice is really a cost to weigh ("unless you pay {N}" asks a KModes
// decision, M2d-2), so accepting every optional trigger is the positive
// play. Crucially it is deterministic: it removes the coin-flip variance
// that widened the confidence intervals this task is about, and it makes
// the same game state always take the same trigger. A perfect effect-aware
// ranking is out of reach without reading the effect; the alternative was
// leaving a coin in place, which the task excludes. Accepted optional
// triggers whose source is no longer worth anything are still accepted,
// because the decision is about whether the trigger's own effect is worth
// taking, not whether the source is castable.

// chooseDiscard keeps cheap plays over expensive ones, without the cast rule's
// blanket creature premium. Basic positively identifies basic lands; zero-CMC
// noncreatures are conservatively land-like (also protects free artifacts).
// Castable is zone eligibility, NOT affordability, and includes hand lands on
// both adapters. No land count or future available-mana census exists here:
// this deliberately protects mana development even when the hand is flooded.
