// Package botpolicy holds the one bot decision policy, in one copy.
//
// Both hosts that need a bot policy -- seat.Bot, answering a view.View, and
// the rules package's fuzz-test testBot, answering with only a *state.Game
// in hand -- build a Board and call Decide. rules cannot import seat without
// running the dependency order backwards (cards -> state -> decision ->
// events -> effects -> rules -> view -> seat; Ruling F7), so before this
// package existed the two sides each carried a line-for-line copy of the
// policy under a "keep the two in step" comment. This package is that
// comment made code: there is one policy, and the two adapters are thin
// value constructions (seat/bot.go's boardFromView; rules/testbot_test.go's
// answer) feeding the same Decide with the same rng consumption points.
// seat/integration_test.go's TestBotAdaptersAgree* pins the two halves to
// the same Board for the same game facts.

	// of it is taxed), and the 21-damage clock (Damage: cumulative combat
	// damage it has dealt, keyed by the player who took it; nil when it
	// has dealt none). Both adapter halves fill it from public facts — the
	// command zone is public (m30 made ZCommand project), and commander
	// identity, cast counts and damage are open information — so the
	// casting rule and the combat clock read the same facts whichever
	// host asks. Damage is keyed by the commander, not its controller:
	// CR 903.10 charges a commander's tally whether the object currently

// Decide implements every decision.Kind the engine (or a future one) can

//     during the upkeep or combat empties the pool before there is anything
//     worth spending it on), then make a land drop, then cast, then pass.
//     IsMain comes from b, so whichever adapter built the Board decides
//     the gate (the seat reads the View's Phase; the rules test host reads
//     e.G.Step.IsMain()). The "activate" block before everything reaches
//     the bot's tap-for-mana activations: legalActions (rules/legal.go)
//     offers only mana abilities as "activate" options ("Tap X for mana"),
//     never non-mana activated abilities (those are "ability"), so it
//     fills the pool in a main phase before the land drop and cast. Which
//     "activate" is tapped stays position-first within the offered group;
//     WHAT the gate asks before tapping any of them is need (tap.go, T1):
//     activate only while the pool cannot currently pay ANY card the seat
//     could cast from a castable zone (hand, command zone, graveyard with
//     Flashback), priced with the CR 903.8 commander tax when the card sits
//     in the command zone, and fall through to the land drop and the cast
//     the moment it can. The pool the gate reads is b.Pool, filled
//     identically by both adapter halves. The old position-first block
//     tapped until nothing untapped was left, floating mana in bulk and
//     letting each step's end (CR 500.4) empty whatever a cast never
//     spent; the need gate keeps the tap until the first cast opens and
//     lets the cast take over (measured, op6: the waste share of floated
//     mana fell from 32.9% to 22.8% constructed and 28.0% to 24.6%
//     four-seat commander, see the task report). The land
//     drop and the cast then order with chooseLand before chooseCast (G0,
//     cast.go).
//   - "concede" (M2d-3): never picked. It is another priority option kind,
//     served last after "pass", but no policy wants to leave the game it
//     is winning; the explicit kind scans below return before any blind
//     fallback, and clamp's top-up prefers "pass" (Ruling T25-g), which
//     legalActions (rules/legal.go) always offers. Unknown option kinds are
//     otherwise never chosen by this switch at all.
//   - KTarget: the targeting heuristic in target.go's chooseTargets (R1-R5,
//     stated there): never target your own permanent while an opposing
//     option exists, prefer the opponent's best battlefield creature over
//     their face (ranked by threat(), not pt() or raw Power), and honour
//     Min/Max without leaning on clamp. Consumes no rng.
//   - KAttackers/KBlockers: the combat heuristic in combat.go's
//     chooseAttackers/chooseBlockers (AR1-AR6 / BR1-BR4, stated there),
//     including the per-attacker defender choice (AR6) and the commander
//     clock (AR5/BR3/BR4). The opt-in LethalPressureDecide variant adds
//     AR7. Neither consumes the rng: the choice is a pure
//     function of the offered options and the board facts both adapters
//     supply.
//   - KTriggerOrder: a permutation of the offered indices drawn from the
//     bot's own rng, so ordering paths get fuzz coverage too.
//   - KTriggerOptional: accept printed optional triggers and Miracle, but
//     decline only api:Effect OptionalDecider$ elections (EffectOptional).
//     Both choices are deterministic and consume no rng.
//   - KChoose: every option in one decision shares a Kind (Option.Kind, not
//     d.Kind) that says what is being chosen. "x" takes the highest option
//     (the most an {X} cost can pay for -- options ascend); "exile"/
//     "sacrifice" take the first Max options; "yes"/"no" always answers yes
//     (Kind "yes" is first, per how askers build the two-option list),
//     except a copy_optional election on a copy of a copy (CH1: a may-copy
//     chain ends after one hand-over) and the repeat_optional stop rules;
//     "name"/"type"/"number" take the first offer. No rng is consumed,
//     unlike KBlockers/KTriggerOrder/KTriggerOptional above.
//   - KMulligan: the London round (Config.Mulligans > 0) offers two shapes on
//     one kind. A bottoming decision (every option Kind "bottom", Min ==
//     Max == taken) bottoms the taken lowest-indexed cards -- Choices
//     [0,1,...,taken-1] in ascending index order. A keep/mulligan decision
//     mulligans with probability 1/3 off the bot's own rng when a
//     "mulligan" option is offered (the determinism mirror of
//     KTriggerOptional), otherwise keeps (the "keep" option at index 0). The
//     rng is consumed only where a real mulligan choice exists.
//   - KModes: a modal announcement or mid-resolution pick -- choose the first Min options
//     in order (Choices [0, 1, …, Min-1]), the recorded mirror of the
//     engine-side first-mode stand-in, no rng. This also answers an
//     UnlessCost$ may-pay, shaped as the same KModes kind: option 0 is
//     "Pay … — make a copy", so the policy always offers to pay and the
//     engine declines for it only when the payer's pool cannot cover the
//     cost.
//
// Anything else — any kind added later, and any case
// above that found nothing to pick — falls to the last resort: pass if one
// is offered and Min == 0, otherwise whatever clamp below tops up with.
//
// Ruling T25-c (fix round 1): every branch used to return its pick
// unclamped, so it only ever validated by coincidence of the Min/Max shapes
// today's engine happens to emit (rules/stack.go's askTarget already names
// TargetMin/TargetMax as coming). clamp is now the last thing every return
// does, so the totality guarantee holds by construction for any Min/Max the

//     ability and every sibling ability of one source is reached (A2 reads the
//     first number in the DESCRIPTION, which is not the cost: Brightling's
//     "+1/-1" mode outranked its three {W} abilities forever).
//   - X3: in a main phase, with probability 1/3, an ability is activated
//     before the land drop and the cast (cycling, channel and other hand
//     abilities of a card the cast would otherwise always consume).
//   - X4: outside a main phase, with probability 1/4, an ability is
//     activated at an ordinary priority window (combat-only targets, upkeep
//     windows, a response to a spell on the stack).
//   - X5: a mana-ability / mana-colour pick is uniform instead of the first
//     offer (exploreManaPick).
//   - X6: mana is floated speculatively (exploreFloat), because the engine
//     offers an ability only once the floating pool pays it and the
//     production tap gate floats only toward a castable card.
