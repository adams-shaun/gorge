// This file is the BLK block-assignment policy: an opt-in KBlockers policy
// (botpolicy.BlocksDecide, exposed to cmd/botbench as the "blocks" policy and
// to nothing else — never the hosted or production bot) that considers the
// whole defender assignment instead of choosing chump/trade per blocker the
// way chooseBlockers does. The rules, each stated for what it reads:
//
//   - B0 (legality first): the only (blocker, attacker) pairs considered are
//     the offered ones (the engine's askBlockers already encodes every
//     legality gate — tap, Flying/Reach, protection, can't-block statics —
//     by omitting the illegal pairs), and one blocker is never assigned to
//     two attackers (CR 509.1a; the wire's Group exclusivity). A Menace
//     attacker is blocked only by teams of at least two (CR 702.111b, which
//     the engine's validateBlockers enforces over the whole declaration).
//   - B1 (survive first): when the unblocked attacking power reaches the
//     defender's known life (or a commander's unblocked swing would close
//     the CR 903.10 clock on this defender — the same second lethal line
//     chooseBlockers' BR3 honours), the assignment is chosen to keep the
//     most life: every attacker is answered biggest-first, each with the
//     cheapest killing block among the offered pairs (lone blocker or a
//     team, every killing prefix simulated), and when nothing kills it a
//     chump block still absorbs damage — a non-trample attacker's whole
//     power lands on its blockers (rules/combat.go's damageStep caps every
//     blocker but the last at its own need, and the last absorbs the
//     remainder), so even a dying chump keeps that power off the defender.
//   - B2 (value trades otherwise): a block is taken only when it is a free
//     kill (the blocker kills the attacker and survives — a lone blocker, or
//     for a Menace attacker a team in which every member survives) or an
//     even-or-up trade (the blocker kills the attacker and dies, and the
//     attacker's power is at least the blocker's — for a team, at least the
//     dead blockers' combined power). A chump block that neither kills nor
//     survives is never taken while not facing lethal.
//   - B3 (determinism): attackers sort by power descending with a
//     clock-closing commander ranked as power 21 (BR4's ordering, shared so
//     both policies answer the same threat first), ties by the attacker's
//     first offered option; blockers sort by pt ascending then ObjID
//     ascending. No rng is consumed and no map iteration order reaches the
//     answer.
//
// The saved-life arithmetic is blockSaved, a direct restatement of the
// engine's damage-assignment loop; like blockCombat it only ever orders a
// decision, never mutates game state.
