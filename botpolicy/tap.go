// T1 -- the need-aware tap gate (task op6). The tap-for-mana "activate"
// options legalActions (rules/legal.go) offers are gated on "do any of the
// cards this seat could cast need mana the pool does not yet have". The old
// position-first block tapped the first "activate" in every main phase
// until every source was spent, floating mana in bulk and letting each
// step's end (CR 500.4) empty whatever a cast never spent; this file
// replaces the WHEN with a need check computed from board facts alone (the
// policy is stateless: no memory across decisions).
//
// The WHICH was position-first when op6 landed, because the View then
// projected no per-permanent mana production and nothing in the offer
// distinguished a Plains from an Island. It no longer is: CardView.Produces
// (dp2) carries each permanent's produced colours, so chooseTap below picks
// the source whose colour answers a pip the pool still owes. See chooseTap's
// own doc comment for the ordering rules; what survives from op6 here is the
// WHEN, not the WHICH.
//
// The check is deliberately the engine's own gate re-derived at the
// granularity botpolicy may read: a card is "castable with the pool" when
// the pool's total covers its converted cost and its coloured pips cover
// every coloured symbol in its printed cost -- the CanPay shape
// rules/cast.go's castable runs, re-expressed over the Board's Card facts
// because botpolicy cannot import rules (Ruling F7). The engine only ever
// offers a "cast" option once the CURRENT pool can pay the cost, so
// "nothing castable yet + tapping could help" is exactly "some castable
// card the pool cannot pay" -- the triggers of the tap loop, and the
// moment the pool pays the cheapest such card the cast options open and
// chooseCast takes over.

// hasFlashback is the tap gate's graveyard-castability test: does the
// derived keyword list (the engine's Derived() output, which the View also
// projects as CardView.Keywords) carry the Flashback keyword? It is the
// policy's mirror of rules/legal.go's own flashback-gate read (e.HasKeyword
// over the same list), with the same head-strip cards.KeywordHead applies

//     computed at resolution from what other objects produce and resolves to
//     whatever colour is asked for when it is tapped. This is the only tier a
//     tap is aimed at a specific pip. A plain conditional "Any" source
//     (Cavern of Souls, and 500+ other corpus cards) is deliberately NOT
//     here: widening the gate to every Any source is a separate behaviour
//     change from the reflected-source fix and moves the botbench golden
//     (ticket cli-20260922T225137Z), so only Produces.Reflected qualifies.
//   - tier 1: a source that demonstrably produces some mana, but none of a
//     needed colour (a screw in colour, or a pure generic shortfall): it at
//     least adds to the pool, so it outranks a source that may produce
//     nothing at all.
//   - tier 2: a source that demonstrably produces nothing -- no known
//     colour slot. An Indeterminate-amount source lands here because it
//     contributes zero to every colour slot (detected via Colour, never by
//     reading the Indeterminate flag), so such a source is a last resort
//     only: it might produce nothing, so chooseTap never PREFERS it over a
//     source that demonstrably produces.
//   - within a tier, the source with the FEWEST distinct colours is tapped
//     first (Task dp2's least-flexible-first: the mono-colour source before
//     the dual, keeping the flexible source for the colour it is still

// T3 -- the converter gate (cardfuzz batch1 lines 3/5/6/10/16/17). A mana
// ability whose cost spends POOL mana and does not tap its source (Farrelite
// Priest's and Bog Initiate's "{1}: Add {W}/{B}", Initiates of the Ebon
// Hand) is a converter: it can be activated any number of times, and each
// activation takes mana out of the very pool the tap gate is trying to fill.
// The T1/T2 gate prices a source only by what it PRODUCES, so a converter
// that produces a needed colour ranked tier 0 and was re-activated forever:
// the engine pays its generic {1} out of the pool in fixed C,W,U,B,R,G order
// (rules/mana.go resolveManaWith), which for a white card against a
// white-only pool spends the {W} it then adds back -- a net-zero cycle, one
// decision per loop, until the engine's livelock watcher fires.
//
// The gate is a class rule over the offered cost, not a card list:
//
//   - a converter is never activated while a "cast" option is offered: the
//     pool already pays something, and spending it on a conversion toward a
//     different card can only undo that (Bog Initiate converted the four {B}
//     that were paying for Frogmite);
//   - otherwise it is activated only when the hypothetical pool after paying
//     its mana cost and adding its production has a strictly smaller
//     payment deficit for the intended card (conversionDeficit) than the
//     current pool. The deficit is a non-negative integer that no tap and no
//     taken conversion ever raises for that card, so the conversions the
//     policy takes toward one intended card are finite, and every turn ends;
//   - a production the policy cannot price (an indeterminate amount) or a
//     cost it cannot read ({X}) is never activated -- fail closed toward the
//     pass, the gate's standing direction.
//
// A mana-costed ability that also TAPS its source (Celestial Prism's
// "{2}, {T}", a filter land) is bounded by the tap and is not a converter;
// it keeps the T2 ordering unchanged.
