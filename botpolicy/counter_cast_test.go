// The C8 leaf pins (task botcounter1): a counter cast is worth its mana
// only at a stack holding a FOREIGN spell. The commit point is the cast
// choice — once cast, the target ask's Min-1 leaves no exit and the bot
// counters its own play — so the rule is stated and enforced here, on the
// plain-data Board both adapter halves build identically. These tests are
// synthetic Board fixtures (no engine, no corpus): the facts the rule reads
// (Card.Counter, Board.Stack) are plain data, and the real-game behaviour
// the rule changes is measured over whole bot games in the task report.
