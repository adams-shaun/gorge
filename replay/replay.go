// Package replay re-executes a match from its recorded event log and
// verifies the rebuilt event stream against the one on file, naming the
// first sequence number where they part ways.
//
// The contract is (Config, Log) together, never the Log alone (Rulings P5,
// T11-d). Genesis -- state.NewGame and the per-deck AddObject calls in
// rules.New -- runs before the log exists and legitimately bypasses events
// (see rules/engine.go's own package doc), so the log can never recover
// deck contents or player names on its own: a faithful replay needs the
// original Config's Names and Decks (the same *cards.Card pointers, in the
// same order) supplied again alongside the Log. Replay and ReplayTo both
// overwrite cfg.Seed with l.Seed before running -- the log's seed is the
// one that produced it, and a caller passing a mismatched cfg.Seed would
// only be replaying a different match by accident.
//
// Everything from the first logged event onward -- turn structure, zone
// moves, life, damage, priority, and every Intent a client ever answered
// with -- is re-derived by running the real rules.Engine against the
// recorded Intents in order, not by reapplying logged events directly (that
// is rules/trigger_test.go's replayFromLog, a rules-internal fidelity
// harness this package does not use or duplicate). Because every state
// change already goes through one path (events.Emit), an engine that is
// unchanged since the log was recorded reproduces it byte for byte; an
// engine that has changed either rejects a recorded Intent outright (a
// plain error -- see run below) or produces an event stream that diverges
// from the recording, reported as a *Divergence naming the first differing
// event.
