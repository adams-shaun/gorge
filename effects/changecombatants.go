// effChangeCombatants implements api:ChangeCombatants's Attacking$ True shape
// (Misleading Signpost, Portal Mage, Windshaper Planetar, and the conjure-and-attack
// Kari Zev, Crew of Two / Stormforged Armor pair): reselect which player each
// defined attacking creature is attacking. Forge's ChangeCombatantsEffect +
// SpellAbilityEffect.addToCombat condensed to what gorge models:
//
//   - only a creature actually attacking, and only in its controller's OWN
//     combat (CR 506.3b — Forge's combat.getAttackingPlayer().equals(
//     c.getController()); gorge combat is always the active player's, so the
//     guard is Controller == g.Active),
//   - the candidate defenders are ALL living players the attacker may be
//     pointed at — every living seat except its controller, the same
//     enumeration askAttackers offers the KAttackers decision (Forge's
//     getAllPossibleDefenders; planeswalker defenders are out of scope —
//     walkers are not attackable in this build),
//   - the resolving controller (Ctx.Controller) picks one per attacker; the
//     answered re-entry emits one CombatRetarget per attacker, and the
//     re-pointed attack is unblocked (the event's Apply case clears BlockedBy
//     — Forge's removeFromCombat + addAttacker + setBlocked(false)),
//   - the re-pointing fires NO new trigger and does not touch
//     AttacksThisTurn: it is not a declaration (which is exactly why the new
//     Kind exists instead of reusing DeclareAttackers/TokenAttacks).
//
// The ask is the "choice" KChoose transport (ChooseCard/ChoosePlayer/
// ChangeTargets' shared seam, reuse rather than a new resume arm), with the
// ask's ResumeTarget carrying the asking attacker's index in the
// deterministic Defined$ walk so the re-entry skips attackers already
// answered (effDig's per-target cursor discipline). The R-9 no-host stand-in
// keeps the original defender and records one Note — never a guessed
// defender. An attacker whose only candidate defender is the one it already
// attacks asks nothing: the decision's every answer is the same no-op, so a
// decision nobody could answer differently is never emitted (the
// effDiscard strict-supersets rule).
//
// Out of scope, each LOUD (a Note naming the shape, then no move — the
// registered equivalent of the unimplemented-API fallback these SAs used to
// hit): every other Attacking$ value (RememberedPlayer midnight_crusader_shuttle,
// Player.OpponentOf CardController capricopian, TargetedPlayer
// portal_manipulator — needs parent-target/trigger-referent plumbing that
// does not exist, and portal_manipulator's ask rides a DEEPER sub the
// mvts1 pre-ask never reaches; `.Defending & Valid Planeswalker.Defending`
// tahngarth_first_mate — needs planeswalker defenders, which do not exist).
// Optional$ True (Windshaper Planetar) is read as mandatory with one Note
// naming the stand-in: a per-attacker may-reselect election is not built.
// Forge's re-point of pending trigger roles (OriginalDefender/
// DefendingPlayer on already-queued stack objects) is out of scope too.
