// effDemonstrate implements DB$ Demonstrate (CR 702.152): the resolution of
// the demonstrate trigger both the printed K:Demonstrate expansion
// (cards/kw_demonstrate.go) and the granted-keyword synthesis
// (rules/trigger_granted.go's checkGrantedDemonstrateTriggers) queue. The
// oracle text the body serves: "Whenever you cast this spell, you may copy
// it. If you do, choose an opponent to also copy it. Each copy becomes a
// token."
//
// The two "may/choose" halves are real mid-resolution asks (the fx42
// transport: Ctx.Demonstrate* fields, rebuilt by rules' "demonstrate" resume
// arm and consumed and cleared at the top of this walk):
//
//   - Stage 0, the election: "you may copy it" -- a yes/no KChoose to the
//     caster (the trigger's controller). A decline ends the trigger having
//     copied nothing. The no-host deterministic answer (an effects-package
//     test double, a fuzz run) is the decline under one R-9 Note.
//
//   - Stage 1, the opponent: "choose an opponent to also copy it" -- a
//     one-pick KChoose over the caster's living opponents in AliveFrom
//     order. Zero living opponents means the clause has no candidate (only
//     the caster's copy exists); ONE means a decision nobody could answer
//     differently, so the copies are recorded without an ask (the
//     strict-supersets convention, the battle-protector precedent). The
//     no-host deterministic answer is the first opponent under one R-9 Note.
//
// Both copies are emitted only once the opponent clause is settled (the
// caster's copy first, then the chosen opponent's): an emission between the
// two asks would put a stack spell on top of the demonstrate wrapper, and the
// opponent ask's resume point -- the top of the stack -- would then re-enter
// the COPY's resolution instead of this body's. Each copy is an ordinary
// StackCopy mint (the same event effCopySpellAbility emits) keeping the
// original's targets -- the standing copy-keeps-targets stand-in the M4
// copy-target task owns (the printed carriers' oracle adds "Players may
// choose new targets for their copies", a choice this build cannot pose). A
// creature-spell copy becomes a token when it RESOLVES, through the standing
// CR 707.10g fold in events.Apply's Move case (enteredFrom ZStack + IsCopy ->
// IsToken) -- the reminder text's "each copy becomes a token", no new mint
// machinery. A copy is never a cast (it emits StackCopy, never PutOnStack),
// so a demonstrate copy cannot re-fire a demonstrate trigger.
