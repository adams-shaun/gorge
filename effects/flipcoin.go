// effFlipCoin implements DB$/SP$/AB$ FlipCoin (82 corpus files): flip a coin
// through the engine's seeded generator (heads = win, tails = lose), record
// each result on the canonical Note (FlipCoinNote — the encoding the
// FlippedCoin trigger matcher reads), and resolve the outcome branch per
// flip. The branch names are resolved through ResolveSVar exactly as
// RollDice's ResultSubAbilities$ are: the base SA carries no auto-link to
// WinSubAbility$/LoseSubAbility$ (cards/link.go links only SubAbility$), so
// this primitive resolves the name itself; the base's own SubAbility$ chain
// (after the branches) is the enclosing Resolve loop's ordinary walk.
//
// Parameters read:
//   - WinSubAbility$ (heads) / LoseSubAbility$ (tails), and the NoCall$
//     lines' spellings HeadsSubAbility$ / TailsSubAbility$ — same heads/tails
//     mapping, NoCall$ itself is cosmetic (Forge uses it to suppress the
//     "calls heads" announcement this build never makes).
//   - Amount$ (default 1): that many independent flips, each running its own
//     branch (TrigFlipCoins' "flip three coins" shape). An unresolvable value
//     degrades to one flip, the RollDice convention — a flip that happened
//     once is closer to "flip X coins" than a silent no-op.
//   - Defined$ / Flipper$: who flips, through one knownDefinedTargets
//     resolver (flipperPlayers). Absent, the resolving controller flips; a
//     present spec that resolves to no player (or an unmodelled selector)
//     flips nothing — the effLosesGame fail-closed convention.
//   - ForEachPlayer$ (one corpus line: Mutalith Vortex Beast's "flip a coin
//     for each opponent"): the flipper set is the named group — "Opponent"
//     is every living opponent of the resolving controller, resolved through
//     forEachPlayerFlippers. Each flipper flips once per iteration and the
//     chained sub sees Ctx.Remembered = that flipper, so the lose branch's
//     Defined$ Remembered deals "to that player".
//   - RememberResult$ True (Goblin Assassin, Mana Clash): every flip is
//     appended to Ctx.FlipMemory, so a chained Defined$ FlippedHeads /
//     FlippedTails (and ValidPlayers$ of the same spelling) resolves to the
//     real flippers of that side.
//   - RememberNumber$ Wins/Losses (Goblin Traprunner, Yusri): the sided tally
//     is published (Ctx.FlipWins/FlipLosses) for a chained bare "Wins"/"Losses"
//     parameter and for Count$RememberedNumber. An unrecognised value is loud
//     and counts wins, matching the Wins default.
//   - RememberLoser$ True (Unleash the Flux): the losers are remembered as
//     player targets (Ctx.Remembered).
//   - FlipUntilYouLose$ True (5 corpus lines: Okaun, Zndrsplt, Toothy and
//     Zndrsplt, Crazed Firecat, Mirror March): flip until the first tails,
//     running the win branch per winning flip and the lose branch once on
//     the losing flip. A win branch that suspends on an ask does NOT abandon
//     the loop: the remaining cursor rides SuspendFlipRest and the host
//     re-enters this primitive once the answered ask's chain completes.
