// effInvestigate implements the Investigate primitive (CR 701.36a; 142
// corpus files -- 120 DB$, 16 AB$, 9 SP$): create Num$ Clue tokens for each
// investigating player.
//
// Count: Num$ (default 1) resolves through the shared Num evaluator -- a
// literal, an SVar name, an inline Count$ body or the bare X of a
// Count$xPaid cast; a present-but-unresolvable value degrades to 0 (the
// card resolves to nothing rather than doing something arbitrary), exactly
// the Num contract.
//
// Players: the investigating player(s) resolve through actingPlayers -- the
// shared "Defined$ else ValidTgts$-targeted else the resolving controller"
// selector every player-acting primitive uses. Defined$ Player.withMostType*
// and the Targeted/Remembered referents resolve inside Defined().
//
// Each Clue is one real TokenCreate event (owner = the investigating
// player), so the mint rides events.Apply and fires trig:TokenCreated /
// trig:TokenCreatedOnce (Mirkwood Bats et al.) exactly like effToken's
// mints, and each investigate also emits one events.Investigate marker
// (trig:Investigated matches it — Erdwal Illuminator; a plain Clue-token
// creation never fires an investigate trigger). No direct state.Game writes.
//
// Optional$ True (2 files: will_the_wise, nick_valentine_private_eye) is a
// real per-player may-investigate election: every affected player is posed
// their own KChoose yes/no (the draw_optional ask shape; the ask goes to the
// AFFECTED seat, never the trigger controller), a yes performs the ordinary
// Clue creation below and a no performs nothing. The answer rides rules'
// "investigate_optional" resume arm into Ctx.InvestigateOpt/Idx, which this
// body consumes and clears at the point of application (fx42 scoping) and
// resets when the walk finishes, so a chained optional Investigate poses its
// own elections. A host that cannot ask keeps the pre-ask mandatory
// investigate (the R-9 degradation the effDraw optional arms take), one
// loud Note per gated resolution.
//
// RememberInvestigatingPlayers$ (1 file, will_the_wise) remembers the
// players who ACTUALLY investigated into the resolution's Remembered (the
// Ctx.Remembered set PlayerCountRemembered$Amount and Defined$ Remembered
// read) AND onto the source object's persistent player-remembered list (the
// same event-backed write RememberChosen$ makes), which is what the
// Opponent.!IsRemembered player filter clause reads -- Will the Wise's
// DBLoseLife "each opponent who doesn't" chains on it. Decliners stay
// unremembered. Absent, the primitive remembers nothing, exactly as before.
