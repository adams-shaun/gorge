// effPlay implements a "play a card from a zone without paying its mana
// cost" effect (Forge's Play API; CR 601.2/117.3a's "play" verb covers
// casting a spell or playing a land from a non-hand zone). The candidates are
// gathered the same way the rest of the engine gathers a Defined$/filter
// population:
//
//   - Defined$ (ExiledWith, Remembered, Targeted, ...) names the card(s)
//     directly and is resolved through context.go's Defined.
//   - Valid$ / ValidZone$ name a filter and a zone to scan (e.g. Spinerock
//     Knoll's Valid$ Card.ExiledWithSource + ValidZone$ Exile).
//   - ValidTgts$ means the ability already targeted a card at placement, so
//     the recorded target is the population.
//
// Whichever population results, the effect poses a KModes "play" choice over
// the candidate cards (or a yes/no when exactly one is offered), and the
// answered choice is carried back through Ctx.Play so rules' resumeResolution
// can begin a zero-cost cast of the chosen card from its current zone. The
// WithoutManaCost$ semantics (cast the card for free) are applied by the cast
// flow, not here, because mana is paid in rules where the cost grammar lives
// (rules/resolution.go's "play" arm; WithoutManaCost$ False and an absent
// param both pay the printed cost, Only a literal True casts free).
//
// The remaining rider parameters:
//
//   - Controller$ names WHO the ask is posed to and whose cast the resume
//     arm begins (Etali's Controller$ You -- the corpus's dominant shape --
//     and an absent param keep the resolving controller; Word of Command's
//     TargetedPlayer, Wild Evocation's TriggeredPlayer and Spell Queller's
//     RememberedOwner route the play to the named seat). An unresolvable
//     value is a fail-closed no-op under one loud Note, never a silent
//     reroute to the resolving controller.
//   - ShowCards$ (Sunbird's Invocation) is the play's public reveal rider,
//     emitted by the resume arm before the cast moves the card out of its
//     hidden zone (see there).
//   - ForgetPlayed$ True (task param:api:Play.ForgetPlayed, read at the
//     PlayDone re-entry below) drops each actually-begun card from the
//     remembered set so a chained "if you don't play it" arm only sees the
//     unplayed remainder.

		// taken. The decline leaves ctx.Play at 0 (the resume arm only sets
		// it for a begun card), so the guard keeps the decline path untouched
		// and the Treasure is created exactly when nothing was played. The
