// Defined's own fallthrough": ok=true with a nil set means the ask was posed
// and SUSPENDED the resolution (the caller must return before moving
// anything), and the answered re-entry consumes Ctx.Choice here. Every other
// shape returns false and the caller keeps Defined's own behaviour
// (placement-chosen targets, Defined$-named objects, the source default).
//
// The ask never fires when the resolution already carries targets (the
// placement ask's answered set) or when the SA also carries Defined$ (an
// already-named fetch list is Forge's no-ask shape). Bounds come from
// TargetMin$/TargetMax$ through the ordinary Num grammar, clamped to the
// eligible count; Min == Max == 0 or an empty eligible set is no ask and no
// move. A host that cannot ask takes the deterministic first-max stand-in
// (R-9), which is exactly what botpolicy's clamp fallback answers with.
