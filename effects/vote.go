// one Note per voting player; this file adds the ONE canonical "players
// finished voting" Note a Mode$ Vote trigger fires on, the same shape

// trig:FlippedCoin (rules/trigger_match.go's flippedCoinMatches).

// Encoding (no events.Event schema change). The carrier must carry the RAW
// BALLOTS, not a pre-split: the two List$ referent sets are relative to the
// TRIGGER SOURCE'S CONTROLLER, which is unknowable when the vote resolves
// (the vote's caster and the carrier permanent's controller are frequently
// different seats in multiplayer). So Player is the vote's caster (for the
// transcript), Obj the resolving vote spell, and Pairs one entry per voter:
// [PlayerRef(voter), ObjID(pick+1)], pick -1 ("voted for nothing") encoded as
// ObjID(0) so a self-contained pair never collides with a valid pick. A
// non-zero Amount marks that a real ballot existed (Choices$/VoteCard$
// admitted at least one option); an empty-ballot vote carries Amount 0 and
// binds neither set. events.Apply folds Note as an inert marker, so the pairs
// are never re-interpreted; the log keeps them, and a replay re-derives the
// trigger's referents from the same event bytes.
