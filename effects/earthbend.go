// effEarthbend is Forge's EarthbendEffect: "target land you control becomes a
// 0/0 creature with haste that's still a land. Put N +1/+1 counters on it.
// When it dies or is exiled, return it to the battlefield tapped."
//
// It is a composite keyword action, not a primitive of its own: the animation
// is the Animate family's layer-4/6 grant (registerAnimateEffects, same
// per-object registration the DB$ Animate bodies use), the counters are the
// ordinary +1/+1 placement (putCounterSplit), and the return promise is a
// one-shot event-matched delayed trigger.
//
// The implicit target lands in the parser, not here: cards/normalizeImplicitTarget
// writes ValidTgts$ Land.YouCtrl into every Earthbend SA at parseSA (Forge's
// EarthbendEffect declares TargetLandYouControl), so Defined() here names the
// chosen land, never the resolving source. The Num$ count resolves the full
// grammar (literal, SVar name and Count$ body) through the ordinary Num
// reader, so a trigger-relative X (Beifong's TriggeredCard$CardPower) reads
// the resolution's own Ctx.SVars + TriggerContext.
func effEarthbend(h Host, c *Ctx, sa *cards.SA) {
	// The count is resolved ONCE, against the same Ctx every target shares.
	// A negative value clamps to zero: the placement helper treats <=0 as a
	// no-op, and a "0/0 with no counters" land is the CR 704.5f SBA's
	// problem, not this primitive's.

	// The animation, built through the shared Animate grant so the layer
	// assignment, the lifetime and the type-ADD reading of "still a land"
	// can never drift from api:Animate. Power/Toughness are
	// SetPower/SetToughness at layer 7b (the 0/0 base), Haste is a layer-6
	// keyword, and Duration$ Permanent keeps the whole grant alive while
	// the land stays on the battlefield -- exactly the oracle's "that's
	// still a land", no end-of-turn reversion. The grant is NOT
	// Stalking-Stones-forever: endOnLeave ends it the moment the land
	// leaves the battlefield, because the card the return promise brings
	// back is a plain land (CR 122.2 already removed the counters; the
	// animation ended with the permanent instance that carried them).

// registerEarthbendReturn lays the land's "when it dies or is exiled, return
// it to the battlefield tapped" promise. Two one-shot delayed registrations
// are minted per affected land -- one per destination -- because the
// engine's ChangesZone matcher reads Destination$ through the single-word
// effects.ParseZone, so a combined "Graveyard,Exile" would only ever match
// its first half (the engine-wide comma-Destination$ defect, ledgered
// separately; this primitive deliberately sidesteps it rather than depending
// on a fix that would move heads).
//
// The registration's Source is the land itself, so the builtin body's
// Defined$ Self resolves to it; the registration's Counter names the builtin
// SVar body (cards/builtinSVars' __kwEarthbendReturn, resolved for an object
// with no SVar table of its own), and Text carries the mode and inline
// trigger body the events/apply.go decode splits back apart. The name
// deliberately avoids the __kwDash/__kwWarp/__kwAtEOT prefixes, so no
// incarnation tracking applies: the promise is consumed at its first fire
// and an object that later returns is not acted on again.
