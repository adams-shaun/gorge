// effShuffle implements DB$ Shuffle (59 corpus files): shuffle one or more
// libraries. Defined$ names the libraries (You, Targeted,
// TargetedController, Remembered, ParentTarget, Player.IsRemembered,
// TriggeredTarget -- every player-valued Defined$ form the corpus uses); with
// no Defined$ and no ValidTgts$ the caster's own library is shuffled, which is
// what the bare "Shuffle your library" lines (a Cost$-only AB) mean.
//
// The shuffle itself is the same Fisher-Yates over h.Rand that a library
// search's own tail (effects/zone.go) and the engine's genesis deal both use,
// emitted as one Secret events.Shuffle per player in Defined-order: the exact
// order is hidden information (view redaction), the fact of the shuffle is
// not. A player target whose seat is invalid is skipped.
