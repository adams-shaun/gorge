// Explore is Forge's ExploreEffect (api:Explore, CR 701.35a — 42 raw corpus
// files carry a `DB$ Explore` body or an `AB$/SP$ Explore` action: the
// Ixalan/LCI explore mechanic — Merfolk Cave-Diver, Queen's Agent, Twists and
// Turns, the Map token's activated ability, ...). "A creature explores by
// revealing the top card of their library. If it's a land card, its owner
// puts it into their hand. Otherwise, its owner puts a +1/+1 counter on the
// creature, then puts the card back on top of their library or into their
// graveyard" (the LCI wording the corpus's SpellDescriptions spell out).
//
// Per explorer and per Num$ (default 1):
//
//   - The replacement tier is consulted FIRST (CR 614.4's window is before
//     the process): ExploreReplaced runs any R:Event$ Explore replacement's
//     ReplaceWith$ body in place and this explorer's own process is skipped
//     entirely — "instead it explores, then it explores again" replaces the
//     whole reveal/counter/move process with the body's own fresh explores.
//   - The top card is revealed publicly (one non-Secret ids-Note, the same
//     shape the Dig window reveal and effReveal's public arm emit).
//   - A land moves library → hand and the explore records.
//   - A nonland poses the destination KChoose ("put the card back or put it
//     into your graveyard"). Options are ordered state-changing-first —
//     option 0 "into your graveyard", option 1 "back on top" — so the no-host
//     stand-in and botpolicy's clamp both bin the card deterministically (the
//     R-9 / TapOrUntap discipline). The +1/+1 counter and the destination
//     move are applied TOGETHER after the answer arrives, in CR order
//     (counter before destination): one code path for the answered,
//     no-host and resumed shapes. The ask therefore precedes the counter in
//     the event log by one recorded election — a DecisionAsk/Made marker
//     pair, no state change, and the counter-before-destination order the
//     rule states is preserved in every state-changing event.
//   - The explore is recorded by one events.Explore marker (trig:Explores
//     matches it; Apply folds nothing).
//
// Defined$ selectors and the ValidTgts$ target ask resolve through the
// ordinary machinery (Defined falls back to the source for a body that names
// neither — the bare `DB$ Explore` self-explore trigger shape). Num$ resolves
// through the ordinary Num evaluator (a literal 2 is the common carrier; an
// SVar/X body resolves at resolution time).
