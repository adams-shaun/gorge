// effCipher implements DB$ Cipher, the body cards/kw_cipher.go mints as the
// SVar rules/stack.go splices onto the TAIL of a Cipher spell's resolution
// chain: "Then you may exile this spell card encoded on a creature you
// control." (CR 702.99a.) It is the ONE home for the encode ask and the
// association -- the combat-damage copy trigger the association grants lives
// rules-side (checkCipherTriggers), because only rules can queue a trigger.
//
// Because the encode is the resolution's last instruction, the spell card is
// still ON THE STACK here, not in the graveyard: the effect must not depend on
// the spell first settling in a resting zone. It exiles the card from
// wherever it is (the stack), which is what makes a replacement that would
// have sent the resolved spell elsewhere irrelevant to whether it may be
// encoded. A declined encode leaves the card on the stack, so the ordinary
// resolution tail (rules/resolution.go's moveResolvedOffStack) sends it to its
// resting zone as usual.
//
// The offer is a single mid-resolution KModes ask over the resolving
// controller's creatures: Min 0 (an empty answer declines -- "you may"), Max
// 1 (exactly one creature is encoded). The choice is carried across the
// suspension in Ctx.CipherDone/CipherPick (the demonstrate transport shape),
// and a host that cannot ask takes the deterministic decline -- the R-9
// no-host contract, matching every other optional keyword the engine poses.
//
// The performing half moves the card to exile and writes the association as
// an ordinary events.Imprint with the "encoded" Text discriminator onto the
// chosen creature (state.Object.EncodedCards), so replay rebuilds it and
// events.Move prunes/clears it when either side leaves its zone.
