// decision with no options (the Squadron Hawk fail-to-find search was the
// live instance) cannot be answered differently by any seat, so posing it
// wedges a client that has no control to send: the seat must answer, and no
// answer exists that the client could render. Such a decision is resolved
// silently by the asking primitive's own deterministic path instead, never
// posted. Exported so rules' single posting boundary (Engine.ask) can reject
// the shape for every construction site at once, including any future one

// resolution, not a degradation, and stays silent.

// Ask is the ONE ask boundary every mid-resolution asking primitive in this
// package goes through. It posts d to the host and reports the outcome,
// except when OnlyEmptyAnswer(d): then the decision is never posted and the
// caller resolves the effect silently, exactly the way its no-host stand-in
// already does (the search still shuffles; a fail-to-find is legitimate
// under CR 701.23b; an empty-library Scry keeps every zero of its cards).
// Wrapping the helper around the call -- instead of a per-site `if` -- is
// what keeps the next asking primitive from reintroducing the soft-lock: a
// site that asks through anything else is caught by rules' Engine.ask
// boundary guard, which fails loudly.
//
// A decision with no options at all is never posted either, whatever its Min.
// With Min 0 it is the empty-answer-only shape above. With Min > 0 no answer
// is legal, and posting it would strand the seat on an ask nobody can answer.
// Both resolve through the site's stand-in as AskEmpty. (A nil decision is
// treated the same way.) This absorbs the no-options skip the choose/control
// primitives shipped in their own Ask, so every asking primitive shares one
// helper.
