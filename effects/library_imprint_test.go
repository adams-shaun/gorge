// The hidden-library ChangeZone mover `applyLibrarySearch` ignored `Imprint$`:
// a search that found a card (Distant Memories' "search your library for a
// card, exile it", Jace, Architect of Thought's -8, Grim Reminder's reveal)
// did NOT record the moved card in the source's persistent imprintedCards
// association, so the follow-up `Defined$ Imprinted` sub-ability resolved
// nothing and the whole chain silently did the wrong thing.
//
// CR 701.23 (search and move): the found card is the search's result; Forge's
// ChangeZoneEffect records every card it moved through `Imprint$ True` in the
// source card's imprintedCards list, which a later ability reads back with
// `Defined$ Imprinted`. That association is durable state, so it must ride an
// `events.Imprint` (folded by events.Apply, replayed byte-identically), never
// a rules-side field written around the event fold.
//
// These tests drive the real compiled corpus SA through the real mover. The
// reverted-hunk failure is in the report; each test asserts its own
// preconditions (the card really sits in the searched library, the SA really
// carries Imprint$ True) so a vacuous setup fails loudly.

// imprintSearchSA loads a corpus card's first ability and asserts it is the
// hidden-library search carrying Imprint$ True this test is about.
