// effToken creates TokenAmount$ tokens of each TokenScript$ (a comma-
// separated list of Game.Tokens stems) for TokenOwner$ (the controller by
// default; the switch below also resolves Opponent -- deliberately only the
// FIRST opponent, not the fan-out the grammar would give -- Player ("each
// player creates ...", every ALIVE seat in seat order via AliveFrom(0)), the
// two trig:Vote vote-carrier sets (one token per voter), Imprinted/
// ImprintedController, RememberedOwner and ThisTargetedPlayer as explicit
// bespoke cases. Every OTHER TokenOwner$ spelling -- the whole
// Targeted*/Triggered*/Remembered*/Chosen* referent family and the qualified
// Player.<qualifier> forms -- is a Forge player selector resolved through
// the SAME shared grammar every other player-valued parameter in this
// package uses (tokenOwnerPlayers over definedSpec, the ordinary Defined$
// resolver): the players, or the controllers of the object targets, the
// spelling names. Only a value that grammar does not know at all falls back
// to the controller, and it says so with a Note so the gap is visible rather
// than silently papered over.
//
// Every token is its own TokenCreate event, in the order this loop visits
// them (outer: TokenScript$ stems left to right; inner: TokenAmount$ copies
// in index order) -- never a map-range order, so replay reproduces the same
// objects with the same IDs. events.Apply's TokenCreate case is what
// actually mints the object from Game.Tokens; this function only ever
// proposes the event through h.Emit, so it stays a pure proposer like every
// other primitive in this package (Ruling: effects never writes state.Game
// directly, only events.Apply does).
//
// An unknown TokenScript$ key is a Note ("unknown token script <key>") and
// creates nothing -- a Link-time diagnostic ought to have already caught a
// script that names a stem outside Game.Tokens, but Resolve's own totality
// stance (never panic on untrusted/unexpected input) applies here too.
//
// TokenTapped$ True makes every token this call creates enter tapped: the
// ordinary Tap event with the "entered tapped" text the ChangeZone paths
// emit for their own Tapped$ (an entry state, not the CR 701.21a event of
// becoming tapped) lands right after each mint, so the token is on the
// battlefield untapped for exactly one folded event and then tapped.
// TokenAttacking$ True (Mobilize, Kari Zev) makes every token this call
// creates enter tapped and attacking the combat's defending player through
// the appended events.TokenAttacks kind; see the implementation comment at
// the read below for the no-defender degrade. The other TokenAttacking$
// selector forms stay census-free gaps.
//
// TokenPower$/TokenToughness$ set the token's P/T from a dynamic value
// (Skyclave Apparition's X/X Illusion, SVar:X:Remembered$CardManaCost): the
// value resolves through the ordinary Num grammar (a signed literal, an SVar
// body, an inline Count$...), and the set is a PERMANENT layer-7b SubSet
// continuous effect on the token itself -- the same registration shape
// Amass uses for its type grant, so it is replay-rebuilt by re-execution
// and dies with the token's battlefield presence. A side the script does
// not name keeps the token script's printed value; a named side the Num
// grammar cannot resolve is a loud Note and the whole set is skipped (the
// token keeps its printed P/T, which for the corpus's */* scripts means a
// 0/0 the zero-toughness SBA sweeps -- the honest degrade, never a silent
// wrong value).
//
// RememberTokens$ True hands every object this call actually created to the
// rest of the chain via Ctx.Remembered, which is how Living Weapon's own
// keyword expansion (cards/keywords.go) attaches the Germ it just made: its
// SubAbility is `DB$ Attach | Defined$ Remembered`, and Resolve walks Sub
// with the SAME *Ctx, so appending here is what that Attach later reads.
//
// RememberOriginalTokens$ True (Forum Filibuster, Diregraf Horde, Dain
// Ironfoot and 5 more corpus carriers, all `DB$ Token` shapes) takes the SAME
// branch. Forge's own distinction is original-token-vs-post-replacement
// mint, and in this build that distinction collapses in favour of the flag:
// every mint this call proposes IS an original token, and EmitTokenCreate
// hands back every mint the event actually created, so each is remembered.
// All 8 carriers are plain `DB$ Token` lines with no `R:` replacement in
// reach (measured at the corpus pin), so the collapse is corpus-inert today.
// tokenOwnerPlayers resolves a TokenOwner$ value through the ordinary
// Defined$ player-selector grammar (definedSpec), the one resolver every
// player-valued parameter in this package reads. Player entries pass
// through; an OBJECT selection (Targeted, Remembered, TriggeredCard, ...)
