//     is the whole answer; otherwise (the Clique's `[self, reanimated]`)
//     filter the captured entries the list does not hold.
//
//   - An ordinary trigger whose source wrote nothing (empty persistent list,
//     empty DelayedRemembered). The capture is all the context has -- the
//     referent a Watcher pump reads, or an explicitly set per-resolution set
//     (VillainousChoice's victim, a gained trigger's remembered object) -- and
//     it is returned unchanged, exactly the read before this helper existed.
//
//   - A delayed-trigger REGISTRATION, which saves the target set it captured
//     at registration time in TriggerContext.DelayedRemembered and seeds that
//     same set into BOTH Remembered and Captured (a Mode$ Phase registration
//     has no firing event, so its saved list IS the referent). That set is the
//     body's own memory, not a firing-event referent: Forge reads it
//     independently of the source's later mutable remembered list, so a source
//     whose memory was cleared or replaced before the delayed trigger fires
//     (Turn to Mist's `TrigReturn: ChangeZone | Defined$ Remembered` after the
//     same card is recast) must still resolve to the registration's original
//     target. When Captured aliases DelayedRemembered it IS that saved set and

// in state) -- plus the two qualifiers only a ValidStack spec carries:
//
//   - "Other" (Reverse the Polarity's, Swift Silence's `Spell.Other`): the
//     object is not the resolving ability's own source object. Same
//     relative-to-source reading the card-spec grammar's Other predicate
//     gives ValidTgts$.
//   - "sharesNameWith <card-spec>" (Grimoire Thief's
//     `Spell.sharesNameWith ExiledWithSource`): the object's face name is
//     the name of some card matching <card-spec>, evaluated with the
//     ordinary object matcher. An inner spec this build cannot resolve
//     (ExiledWithSource needs exile provenance it does not track) matches no
//     card, so the name set is empty and the token admits nothing -- the
//     fail-closed direction, never widened.
//   - "otherAbility" (Ulalek, Fused Atrocity's
//     `Ability.YouCtrl+otherAbility`): the object is not the ability
//     currently RESOLVING, nor any other instance or copy of that same
//     printed ability. The anchor is Ctx.ResolvingObj -- the stack-object
//     wrapper rules knows as e.resolvingObj / rp.obj -- NOT Ctx.Source,
//     which for an ability resolution is the source PERMANENT (Ruling
//     T20-b) and is not on the stack, so a Source-anchored exclusion would
//     exclude nothing and Ulalek's trigger would copy itself (each copy
//     asking its pay question again -- an unbounded regress). The family
//     half (same Source permanent AND same Ability pointer -- StackCopy
//     preserves both, and every mint of one printed trigger shares the
//     parsed slice's pointer) is the loop guard's second half, needed the
//     moment MORE THAN ONE instance of the trigger can be on the stack at
//     once: a paid Ulalek trigger's copy is itself an ability wrapper, the
//     copy asks the same {C}{C} question on resolution, and a
//     deterministic host answers it the same way every time -- the walk
//     never terminates. Oracle text would copy other instances and let
//     each copy's controller decline; this build's hosts cannot express a
//     decline (the recorded stand-in, see the abcopy3 row). A context with
//     ResolvingObj zero (a hand-built one, or a resolution path that never
//     set it) falls back to the Ctx.Source id alone -- never widened.
