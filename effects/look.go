// emitLook is the ONE construction point for a private look: an effect (or
// engine flow) that shows hidden-zone cards to a SUBSET of the table rather
// than revealing them to everyone. Every looker-scoped effect in the engine
// routes through here — the round-2 review of the Gitaxian Probe merge found
// one of them (RevealHand's Look$ arm) emitting its look as a PUBLIC Note,
// handing the target's whole hand to every seat and spectator, so the class
// was fixed by funnelling all of them through this helper:
//
//   - effReveal's Look$ arm (RevealHand/Reveal/PeekAndReveal with Look$ True;
//     28 corpus RevealHand lines — Gitaxian Probe, Glasses of Urza, Slayer's
//     Bounty): the activator looks at the target's hand. CR 701.20e: a card
//     looked at this way is shown only to the player the effect specifies.
//   - effDig's ask-path look (the window the library's owner is choosing
//     from).
//   - effRearrangeTopOfLibrary, effScry and effSurveil (the KArrange looks
//     at the top of the library).
//
// It emits ONE Secret Note per looker with Player = that looker, so rule (1)
// of view.RedactEvents scopes the payload (ids and text) to them alone:
// every other seat and a Public spectator get the bare shape (and the
// generic "looks at hidden cards" transcript line), and an Omniscient
// spectator keeps the payload only for a HAND look (From == ZHand — their
// visibility already includes every hand, per Ruling FL-9's library-order
// carve-out not applying to one). The looked-at zone rides From so the
// looker's transcript line can name it even after the cards have moved on;
// existing library-top callers pass ZLibrary, which is also the zero value
// their events always carried, so their encoded bytes are unchanged.
//
// text is the clause after the looker's name on their own copy's transcript
// line; the hand look passes "" so view.Describe's ids branch renders the
// full line (who looked, whose hand, which cards) from the payload itself.

// poseLookAck is the bare private look's pacing gate (lookack, task
// fb-20260917T232325Z-35cfca4b): the one information transfer in the engine
// that used to land as a Secret Note with NO decision attached, so a
// client's auto-passing priority streamed the line past before the player
// could read it. effReveal's two bare arms (NoReveal$ True — Mishra's
// Bauble — and the mandatory Look$ True arm — Gitaxian Probe) pose this ask
// BEFORE the note: a KChoose with ONE option ("Continue") to the looker,
// whose prompt names what is about to be looked at and where — the library
// is not projected to the looker's seat (view exposes only LibrarySize), so
// the modal is the readable surface, the same channel the PeekAndReveal
// optional branch uses. The decision is Min == Max == 1 over one option, so
// AskEmpty is unreachable by construction. The ask gates only the PACING:
// there is no decline (CR 701.20e requires the look to happen), so any
// answer — the single Continue option, a malformed empty one included —
// acknowledges, and the resume arm (rules' "look_ack") sets Ctx.LookAck for
// the re-entered effReveal to consume at its emit point.
//
// Returns true when the ask was posted and the caller must return (the
// resolution is suspended); false when no host could ask (R-9) and the
// caller should emit the look immediately — information is never lost to a
// host that cannot ask, the same deterministic degradation Scry/Surveil
// carry.
