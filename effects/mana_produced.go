// prefix is a single one of the five coloured-mana letters and there is at
// least one, so "Combo R G" returns (["R","G"], true) and "Combo Any" (which
// keeps its five-colour meaning), "Combo Chosen", "Combo ColorIdentity" and
// "Combo W B G C" (colourless is not a colour this engine asks for) all
// return (_, false) so the caller falls back to its own handling rather than
// inventing a colour list. rules' mana-activation colour ask and effMana's
// fail-closed walk share this one classifier so the two cannot disagree.
