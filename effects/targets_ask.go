// chosenTargetsFor serves ANY ValidTgts$-declared SA that resolves with no
// ask having covered its targeting: the generic pre-ask inside
// effects.Resolve's dispatch loop (task mvts1). The placement ask
// (rules/trigger_queue.go pushTrigger) and the announcement ask
// (rules/stack.go resolveTop's ability/spell branches) cover only the
// depth-1 body of a trigger or cast -- a deeper sub of the Execute chain
// (the "when you do" family: Mogg Bombers' DealDamage, Aria of Flame's
// verse ping, Kor Outfitter's Attach) used to arrive here with no chosen
// targets and either moved nothing silently or inherited the OUTER SA's
// targets. This poses the sub's own ask through the same Host.LegalTargets
// census the placement ask uses, as a KChoose over the "tgts" resume arm;
// the answer lands in Ctx.TargetsPick and the re-entered pass consumes it
// (the ask's ResumeSA is exactly this SA, so the pending frame re-enters
// it). A host that cannot ask takes the deterministic first-max stand-in
// (R-9), which is what botpolicy's first-option KChoose default answers
// with for card/player options.
//
// The ok return is NOT "targets were found" -- it is "use the returned set
// INSTEAD of Defined's own fallthrough": ok=true with a nil set means the
// ask was posed and SUSPENDED the resolution (effects.Resolve stops before
// dispatching the body), and the answered re-entry consumes
// Ctx.TargetsPick here. Every other shape returns false and the caller
// keeps Defined's own behaviour.
//
// The ask never fires when the SA also carries Defined$ (an already-named
// fetch list is Forge's no-ask shape) -- with ONE carve-out: API$ Fight,
// the one primitive whose SA carries TWO independent target lists
// (Defined$ names the fighter(s), ValidTgts$ names the creature(s) they
// fight). A Fight sub reached deeper in an Execute chain (Kraul
// Harpooner's DB$ Pump | Defined$ Self | SubAbility$ DBFight) would
// otherwise never be asked for its opponent, and its fight would stay
// silently inert even with effFight implemented -- the placement ask
// cannot reach a depth-2 sub. The execute-shaped Fight bodies (Warbriar
// Blessing) and the modal Charm-mode ones (Voracious Hydra) are still
// skipped below: their placement ask already ran and set OfferedSA, so
// the Line match skips them before any ask is re-posed. When it is an
// API$ ChangeZone body
// (effChangeZone's own mid-resolution ask, changeZoneChosenTargets, owns
// that shape -- the closed ChangeZone slice), when this is the depth-0
// entry SA of a resolution whose TargetsOffered marker is set (the
// placement ask covered exactly that SA; its targets are already in
// Ctx.Targets and a Min-0 elected-zero must not be re-posed), or when an
// answered pre-ask for this very SA is waiting in Ctx.TargetsPick. Bounds
// come from TargetMin$/TargetMax$ through the ordinary Num grammar,
// clamped to the eligible count; Min == Max == 0 or an empty eligible set
// is no ask and no move -- a decision nobody could answer differently is
// never emitted, and a ValidTgts$ spec that matches nobody (an unknown
// predicate fails closed) keeps today's empty-set no-op.
//
// Deliberately NOT honoured here (measured carrier population: one sub
// each, both noted in the mvts1 report): DividedAsYouChoose$ -- the ask
// offers the plain TargetMin$/TargetMax$ bounds, exactly like the placement
// ask does for the same parameters.
//
// TargetsForEachPlayer$ IS honoured (pfpe1; the mvts1 round deliberately
// skipped it): the bounds read the OneEach spellings against the distinct-
// controller count of the eligible candidates, and the pose attaches each
// option's controller Group -- the same label rules' ask sites attach -- so
// Decision.Validate's mutual-exclusion rule enforces one pick per
// controller on the wire whatever host answers. A depth-2 SubAbility$
// carrier (Kaya, Spirits' Justice's exile-each; mega_flare,
// tasha_the_witch_queen, geths_summons) reaches its ask here.
