// effBlight implements Forge's Blight (CR 701.60): for each player the
// Defined$ spec names — including the ValidTgts$ fallback, which makes
// Champion of the Weird's TARGETED OPPONENT the blighting player, not the
// ability's controller — that player chooses a creature they control and puts
// Num$ −1/−1 counters on it. A player controlling no creature blights nothing
// (CR 701.60's "a creature you control" never fails open onto someone else's
// creature). The choice is a real KChoose only when the player controls two or
// more eligible creatures — the strict-supersets rule every asking primitive
// here shares (effDiscard's TgtChoose, effSacrifice's player branch): with
// exactly one creature the deterministic answer IS the only legal answer, so
// the counters are placed silently; with none there is nothing to place.
//
// This is not a PutCounter variant: blight's Defined$ resolves to PLAYERS who
// each choose an OBJECT. The structural precedent is effSacrifice's
// player-target branch: the per-target cursor (BlightTarget) travels through
// the decision's ResumeTarget, the answer re-enters through ResumeKind
// "blight" with Ctx.BlightPicks set, and re-entry skips the targets already
// processed before the suspension so a multi-player Defined$ (High Perfect
// Morcant's Defined$ Opponent) asks each opponent in turn.
