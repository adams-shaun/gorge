// object whose OWN Enchant spec names a player (Enchant:Player /
// Enchant:Opponent), a living seat. The very first legal target wins, which
// is what makes the living-weapon shape work (the freshly minted germ is
// Remembered[0]).
//
// When no Defined$ target qualifies -- a seat the attaching object cannot
// enchant, a non-battlefield object, obj itself, or nothing legal at all --
// it refuses with a Note rather than emitting an Attach. The refusal is how
// the effect stays deterministic and observable while it has nothing legal
// to do.
//
// Choices$ names the pool the RESOLVING CONTROLLER picks the unspecified
// side from: with no Object$ key it names the OBJECT to attach (Goldwardens'
// Gambit's "you may attach an Equipment you control to it",
// unexpected_request's same shape); with Object$ present it names the
// DESTINATION (Breath of Fury's "attach CARDNAME to a creature you
// control"). The pool is the battlefield sweep the filter admits, evaluated
// with the resolving controller as You; the choice poses a real KChoose
// (Min 0 when Optional$ True -- picking nothing is the decline -- else Min
// 1), the answered ids ride Ctx.AttachChoice (consumed and cleared, fx42
// scoping), and the asking pass's resolved destination list rides the ask so
// a RepeatEach body's Defined$ Imprinted binding -- which does not survive a
// suspension -- never has to be re-derived. A mandatory Min-1 pool with
// exactly one candidate takes it without an ask (the strict-supersets
// convention: a decision nobody could answer differently is never emitted);
// an Optional pool with nothing eligible declines silently, and a mandatory
// one falls to the same Note refusal an illegal destination gets.
//
// An Optional$ True Attach WITHOUT Choices$ (Ajani's Chosen's "you may attach
// it to the token", Cori-Steel Cutter's "you may attach this Equipment to
// it") asks its controller a yes/no KChoose before attaching, through the
// shared Ask boundary with the "attach_optional" resume arm; a decline emits
// no Attach and no refusal Note, and the chained SubAbility$ still runs (the
// suspension plumbing in effects.Resolve owns the chain). A host that
// cannot ask takes the deterministic decline stand-in (R-9); botpolicy's
// clamp fallback answers option 0, which is the "yes" option, so bots
// attach. With NO legal target the existing Note refusal fires and no ask
// is ever posed (a decision nobody could answer differently).
//
// RememberAttached$ True (all seven corpus carriers) puts the permanent just
// attached into the ability's Remembered, both halves -- the ctx list the
// chained SubAbility / the RepeatEach loop's folding reads (the filter
