// shieldBody is the replacement body every shield this primitive registers
// carries: rules' damage-replacement dispatcher (rules/replacement.go's
// applyReplaceDamageBody) resolves it through the registered pool binding,
// which the same application path depletes after each partial prevention.
// Count$ChosenNumber is the head that reads ContinuousEffect.ChosenNumber —
// the pool rules decrement — so the match gate and the application always
// see the SAME remaining amount and a spent shield prevents nothing.
const shieldBody = "DB$ ReplaceDamage | Amount$ Count$ChosenNumber"

// effPreventDamage implements "SP$/AB$/DB$ PreventDamage" (Forge's
// PreventDamageEffect, CR 615): "prevent the next N damage that would be
// dealt to <target> this turn" — the one-shot rules-generated shield the
// printed prevention REPLACEMENT machinery (R:DamageDone Prevent$ True,
// DB$ ReplaceDamage bodies, stat:CantPreventDamage) cannot create, because a
// replacement line can only modify the damage event that is already
// happening. This primitive installs a real shield: one continuous
// DamageDone replacement per chosen recipient, scoped by its own captured
// recipient (rules' effect-created matcher, never the filter grammar — see
// the marker below), lasting until end of turn and depleting across events.
//
// The registered shape is exactly the one rules' dispatcher already resolves:
// ReplacementEvent "DamageDone" with a DB$ ReplaceDamage body whose Amount$
// reads Count$ChosenNumber, and ContinuousEffect.ChosenNumber carrying the
// per-recipient pool. The same head the SetChosenNumber$ binding machinery
// threads (rules' seedEffectReplCtx) therefore serves as the pool; rules'
// applyReplaceDamageBody decrements it after every application and drops the
// shield when it is spent, so "the next N" is a total across events, not a
// per-event allowance (CR 615's shield semantics; the Divine Deflection
// family's unworn DivideShield$ depletion is this primitive's own, not a
// retroactive change to that registration path).
//
// Scoping convention: every shield's ReplacementParams carry
// PreventionShield= "True" and rules' damageReplacementMatches scopes such a
// match by the registration's own Remembered (objects) /
// RememberedPlayers (players) lists — membership, not a ValidTarget$ filter
// spec. The filter grammar is deliberately not used: its IsRemembered
// predicate UNIONs the source's event-backed remembered list with the
// registration's capture, which would let unrelated remembered state widen
// the promise. The marker key is registration-internal (no corpus R: line
// carries it); a printed line is unaffected because the marker only reaches
// the matcher through the effect-created path's params copy.
//
// DividedAsYouChoose$ N divides the NAMED TOTAL among the chosen recipients —
// the same deterministic round-robin stand-in the DealDamage and PutCounter
// divisions ship (effects/damage.go, effects/counters.go): one point at a
// time in answer order, so earlier-chosen recipients take the extras and the
// total is exactly N. A real per-recipient allocation ask is the division
// ask's recorded stand-in everywhere else too.
//
// Unread, loud (each emits one Note naming the parameter and installs no
// shield): the random-recipient shape (whimsy's Random$ True |
// CardChoices$/PlayerChoices$ — this engine forbids ambient randomness), and
// a PreventionSubAbility$ whose ShieldEffectTarget$ is not the corpus's
// ParentTarget. A resolvable-but-zero Amount$ installs nothing (a shield
// that prevents nothing is no decision); an amount the numeric grammar
// cannot resolve is loud rather than silent.
