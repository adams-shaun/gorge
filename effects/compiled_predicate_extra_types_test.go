// TestCompiledPredicateExtraTypesAware guards the layer walk's fast path: a
// compiled type predicate must answer the SAME derived type set the textual
// oracle reads through SpecContext.ExtraTypes, so the sidecar can stay
// installed for a derived-characteristics match (rules/layers.go
// matchesWithTypes) instead of being cleared for the whole walk.
//
// The carrier is a printed Land whose ExtraTypes has been made a Creature --
// exactly the layer-4 state a manifested Forest under Maskwood Nexus reaches
// (CR 708.5 base {Creature} plus an AddAllCreatureTypes$ grant). Before the
// fix matchesCompiledBase called hasType, which reads the printed face and
// returned a definite PredicateNo for `Creature.YouCtrl`, bypassing the
// ExtraTypes-aware textual oracle.
