// Ability/Targets carry over. Token had the identical shape (see the Task
// 18 report for the original analysis of both) and closed it in Task 13 via
// events.TokenCreate, whose Apply case mints the new object from
// Game.Tokens; see token.go. CopySpellAbility's own object comes from
// wherever it is on the stack already, not a registry, so it needs its own
// event kind (StackCopy exists as of Task 12) wired up rather than reusing
// TokenCreate's shape verbatim. Registering it as a Note-only stub would
// make Supported()/Coverage claim a card is playable when it cannot
// actually do what its text says. Left unregistered, Resolve's existing

// effEffect creates a lasting effect object holding StaticAbilities$ for

// Registration is deliberately scoped: only the CantTarget and CantRegenerate
// modes become real effects this round. Every other StaticAbilities$ mode ---
// and every Triggers$ entry (Palace Jailer's "exile until an opponent becomes
// the monarch" is a command-zone trigger this build does not model) --- is
// still recorded as a Note, so nothing silently no-ops into looking supported
// when it is not. The registry entry the engine (rules/layers.go active())
// expires is the same until-end-of-turn / source-leaves discipline every other
// continuous effect uses: an Effect from an instant or sorcery (a one-shot

// DealDamage's -- events.Apply's ManaAdd case is a plain "+=", so an
// unclamped negative would drop the pool below zero instead of doing

//
// A resolution-time host now gets the same CR 106.6 colour choice as the
// activation path. A host without a decision channel keeps the R-9 fallback:
// Any becomes colourless and an unasked Combo list retains its old full-listed
// output. A dual-producing ability such as "Add {R}{R}" is walked one symbol
// at a time rather than split on whitespace, since Produced$ carries no spaces
// of its own.
//
// The one thing this primitive must NEVER do is walk a value it does not
// understand. A "Combo R G" reaches effMana from a path with no colour
// chooser (the activation path substitutes the chosen colour in first), and
// walking it one rune at a time turned "Combo R G" into five stray
// colourless plus a red and a green -- o, m, b are not mana symbols. An
// unrecognised Produced$ value therefore emits nothing and records a Note
// naming it, following this repo's fail-closed convention (an unknown token
// never invents a value).
// effReplaceMana rewrites one in-flight ManaAdd event for a ProduceMana
// replacement. The surrounding rules code supplies the amount and colour in
// Ctx, then logs the rewritten ManaAdd; this effect itself has no game-state
// mutation to emit. ReplaceAmount multiplies the whole production.
// ReplaceType/ReplaceColor preserve its amount and replace only its colour;
// ReplaceMana is Forge's "one mana instead of any other type and amount"
// form (Damping Sphere, Contamination), so it sets the amount to exactly one
// as well as replacing the colour. For a choice-valued replacement
// (Any/Chosen), rules parks the ManaAdd and supplies the player's W/U/B/R/G
