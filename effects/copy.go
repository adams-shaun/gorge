// effCopySpellAbility duplicates the spell named by Defined$ (Task 17). Two
// shapes exist in the corpus:
//
//   - Defined$ Parent: the spell currently resolving (c.Source) — Chain
//     Lightning's own copy clause.
//   - Defined$ TriggeredSpellAbility: the trigger's remembered object, i.e.
//     the spell whose cast FIRED the trigger — Storm (cards/keywords.go
//     expands kw:Storm into exactly this).
//
// Amount$ copies are placed on the stack by StackCopy events (default 1),
// each copy keeping its targets unless the creating SA declares
// MayChooseTarget$ True (CR 707.10c: that copy's controller may choose new
// targets). The permission rides the StackCopy event's Amount discriminator,
// which rules/stack.go's resolveTop reads as a one-shot target election over
// the copy's own target requirement — so an external copier (Mirari, Cloven
// Casting, a Storm or Replicate copy) grants it too. Copies keep their
// targets only when the parameter is absent or False.
//
// UnlessCost$ (Chain Lightning, String of Disappearances) rides the ONE
// shared unless gate (effects.Resolve's unlessProceed dispatch, shared by
// every API): the payer is UnlessPayer$'s resolved target (default the
// target's controller), the pay/decline labels live in poseUnlessAsk's
// CopySpellAbility arm, and the copy loop below runs, or not, exactly once
// per the gate's orientation (rules' unless_pay resume arm charged the cost
// on an affordable "pay"). A host that cannot ask (an effects-package test
// double) keeps the deterministic decline.
