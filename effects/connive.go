// Connive is Forge's ConniveEffect (api:Connive, CR 702.59 — 53 raw corpus
// files carry a `DB$ Connive` body or an `AB$/SP$ Connive` action: the
// New Capenna connive mechanic — Ledger Shredder, Raffine's Silencer, Lethal
// Scheme's convoked sub, Mask of the Schemer's X-trigger, ...).
//
//	"Connive N" means "Draw N cards, then discard N cards. Put a +1/+1
//	counter on this permanent for each nonland card discarded this way."
//	(702.59a; a connive with no N connives 1 — 702.59b.)
//
// Per conniver and per ConniveNum$ (default 1):
//
//   - The draws come first (all N, before any discard), through the same
//     resumable draw path effDraw uses (drawFor with a cursor and the
//     Connive SA as ResumeSA), so a Dredge replacement over a connive draw
//     is a real choice exactly as for any other draw AND the connive is
//     resumable across it: the ask that parks carries the draw cursor, the
//     dredge resume arm restores it (ctx.DrawDone), and the re-entered
//     effConnive finishes the remaining draws before its discard, counter
//     and record. A bare DrawFor loop would pose a second ask over the
//     outstanding one (the orphaned-decision panic findings-sol4 proved).
//   - The discards follow: N cards from the conniver's controller's hand.
//     Connive has no discard filter ("discard a card"), so the eligible set
//     is the whole hand. The strict-supersets rule (the effDiscard
//     TgtChoose discipline) applies: a hand with FEWER OR EXACTLY N cards
//     discards everything it owns in hand order and asks nothing — a
//     decision nobody could answer differently is never emitted — and a
//     hand with more than N poses a real KModes ask (Min = Max = N, options
//     in hand order), whose answer re-enters through rules' "connive" arm
//     and Ctx.ConniveDiscard. A host that cannot ask and botpolicy's KModes
//     clamp both take the first N options (the front N cards), so the
//     no-host stand-in and the bot answer are byte-identical by
//     construction and no R-9 Note is owed (the Explore discipline).
//   - The counters come last: one +1/+1 counter per NONLAND card discarded
//     (CR 702.59a's "for each nonland card discarded this way"), one
//     CounterChange carrying the whole count.
//   - The action is recorded by one events.Connive marker per completed
//     connive (IDs the discarded cards in discard order, Amount the nonland
//     count) — what trig:Connives matches. One marker per connive, never
//     one per discarded card.
//
// Defined$ selectors (TriggeredSourceLKICopy, Targeted, TriggeredCardLKICopy,
// Convoked, ReplacedCard, TriggeredAttackerLKICopy, ...) and the ValidTgts$
// target ask resolve through the ordinary machinery (Defined falls back to
// the source for the bare `DB$ Connive` self-connive trigger shape, the 27
// SVar:TrigConnive carriers). ConniveNum$ resolves through the ordinary Num
// evaluator (a literal is the common carrier; an X body resolves at
// resolution time, a body whose X never resolved connives 0 and does
// nothing).
