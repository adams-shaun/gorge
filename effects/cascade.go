// Cascade (CR 702.85, task cascade1). The keyword is implemented as a real
// triggered ability: rules' cast flow queues one pendingTrigger per Cascade
// instance (printed K:Cascade line or layer-6 grant), the drain mints a
// respondable KeywordTriggerPush stack object whose "__kwCascade" payload
// events.Apply rebuilds into the DB$ Cascade body registered here, and the
// ability's RESOLUTION runs the exile-until + may-cast sequence.
//
// CR 702.85a, as implemented:
//   - "exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland
//     card that costs less" — the scan walks the caster's library in zone
//     order (index 0 = top), exiling each card with a logged MoveZone (the
//     exile is public: the Note after the loop names every exiled id, the
//     same non-Secret ids-Note shape effDigUntil's reveal emits), and stops
//     at the first nonland card whose mana value is STRICTLY less than the
//     cascade spell's. The found card itself is exiled too — a later free
//     cast is cast FROM EXILE, exactly as the oracle says.
//   - "You may cast it without paying its mana cost" — a real optional
//     election through the effPlay shape (DB$ Play | WithoutManaCost$ True |
//     Optional$ True, population = the found card), whose answer rules'
//     resumeResolution "play" arm turns into a zero-mana-cost cast from
//     exile. The population rides the resolution's Remembered.
//   - "Put the exiled cards on the bottom in a random order" — the random
//     order is the engine's standing determinism stand-in (the same one the
//     Dig rows record in AGENTS.md): the cards return in their existing
//     library order. The cards that did not match are bottomed right after
//     the scan (before the election — nothing between the election and that
//     bottoming can observe the difference, and the found card would be the
//     last move either way); the found card is bottomed by the chained
//     CascadeBottom sub-ability when it was NOT cast (it is still in exile),
//     and is a no-op when it was (it is on the stack).
//
// The cascade spell's mana value is the PRINTED value of its face read at
// resolution (CR 202.3): no corpus K:Cascade carrier carries {X} (measured),
// so the X-in-cost caveat the stack-object mana value would need is
// corpus-unreachable. The candidate's mana value is likewise its printed
// face value, with {X} counted as 0 (CR 202.3b) — the same read every other
// mana-value comparison in the engine makes off a Face.
//
// A library with no qualifying card exiles everything to the last card and
// bottoms it all with no election (the scan simply runs out).
