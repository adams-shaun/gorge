// AtEOT$ is Forge's end-of-turn rider: "at the beginning of the next end
// step" the affected object leaves the battlefield (exiled, sacrificed,
// returned to hand, destroyed). It rides the same delayed-registration
// machinery dash/warp/encore and CopyPermanent already use -- one
// events.DelayedRegister per affected object, fired one-shot by
// rules.checkDelayedTriggers at the first end step reached after resolution,
// resolved through the builtin SVar bodies in cards/builtinSVars.
//
// The affected set is the primitive's own: Animate/Pump act on their
// per-object targets, Token on each mint, ChangeZone/ChangeZoneAll on the
// objects the move actually moved (some carriers RememberChanged$ and some
// do not, so the moved set is passed in rather than read back out of
// Remembered).
//
// TIMING READING (deferred nuance, stated here once): Forge distinguishes
// "at the beginning of YOUR next end step" (YourExile/YourSacrifice/
// YourExileUpkeep...) from the bare "the next end step". This build treats
// the Your-prefixed values as their plain equivalents -- the first end step
// reached after resolution -- because the corpus's carriers overwhelmingly
// resolve on their controller's own turn, where the two coincide. The
// divergence (a rider resolving on an opponent's turn would fire at that
// opponent's end step, a turn early) is recorded in the report.
//
// Values outside the implemented set stay LOUD: one Note per call naming the
// value, with the body still applied (the CopyPermanent convention). A value
// is never silently dropped.

// exiled by a stale promise; events/apply.go tracks the __kwWarp and
// __kwAtEOT prefixes), __kwDashReturn and __kwAtEOTDestroy likewise.
// __kwEncoreSacrifice is not tracked, the CopyPermanent convention. Every
// off-battlefield stale promise is a no-op at fire time: warp/dash carry an
// Origin$ Battlefield guard, and effSacrifice's object path skips an object
// that is not on the battlefield.

// atEOTInclude decides whether id is part of an AtEOT$-bearing body's affected
// set. For a `Defined$ Remembered` spec the engine seeds Ctx.Remembered with
// the trigger REFERENT (rules.triggerRemembered returns the event's object),
// which Forge's own card remembered list does not contain -- so a bare
// referent is not an affected object. The source is kept only when the card's
// own persistent event-backed list genuinely remembered it (a
// Self-remembering body), the rememberedWithSource convention
// Count$RememberedSize and the condition grammar already read.
//
// KNOWN PARTIAL, not a fix of the underlying defect: the referent seeding is
// why Puppeteer Clique's own `DB$ Animate | Defined$ Remembered` still grants
// Haste to the Clique itself (the referent IS the Clique, so Defined() names
// it as a target while this filter correctly withholds the rider) -- the
// card behaves inconsistently (Clique hasty but not exiled). The proper fix
// is in the resolver (match Forge's card remembered list the way
// effChangeZone's O-Ring rescue does), which is engine-wide and its own
// ticket; this guard only stops the wrongly-named object from also being
// exiled by a stale promise. Ledgered in the task report's Issues.
