//   - Mode$ RevealYouChoose (Thoughtseize, Duress): the CASTER — c.Controller,
//     not the discarding player — looks at the target's hand and chooses which
//     card is discarded. This is a real mid-resolution ask: the effect poses a
//     KModes decision over the DiscardValid$-filtered hand, suspends, and on
//     re-entry discards exactly the card Ctx.Discard names (the continuation
//     arm in rules/resolution.go set it from the recorded answer). A host
//     that cannot ask falls back to the deterministic front-card stand-in.
//   - Mode$ TgtChoose (Mind Rot, Faithless Looting, Thirst for Knowledge,
//     Riddlesmith): the ordinary "discard N cards" — the DISCARDING player,
//     p (the target, not the caster), chooses which of their own cards to
//     drop, without the hand being revealed first. Same mid-resolution ask
//     shape as RevealYouChoose, same ResumeKind "discard", but the decision's
//     Player is p and the no-ask fallback takes the front of the FILTERED
//     hand. A hand with fewer eligible cards than NumCards$ discards what it
//     owns and asks nothing (there is no choice to be made), and a hand
//     whose eligible count is at or below NumCards$ likewise resolves
//     deterministically with no question. Optional$ True (Mox Diamond's
//     "you may discard a land card", "discard up to two cards") first poses
//     a yes/no may-discard election (ResumeKind "discard_may", answered into
//     Ctx.DiscardVote): "no" discards nothing, "yes" poses the pick with
//     Min 1.
//   - Mode$ RevealDiscardAll (Cabal Therapy): a FILTER, not a choice. Every
//     card in the target's hand matching DiscardValid$ is discarded, no ask.
//   - Mode$ Hand (Reforge the Soul, Windfall, Magus of the Wheel, Dark
//     Deal): the whole-hand wheel — every card in the target's hand, in hand
//     order, one events.Discard per card, no ask and no Note (a mandatory
//     line has no choice to record). Forge's DiscardEffect HAND mode
//     discards the ENTIRE hand and never reads NumCards$ there. The
//     Optional$ True variant is a real may-discard election: a per-player
//     yes/no (Ctx.DiscardVote with the per-player cursor Ctx.DiscardTarget)
//     whose decline discards nothing.
//   - Mode$ Random: CR 701.8b's random discard — the engine's own seeded RNG
//     (h.Rand) picks NumCards$ cards out of the DiscardValid$-filtered hand
//     without replacement. No seat is asked and no Note is recorded: the
//     randomness IS the rule, not a stand-in for a missing ask.
//   - Mode$ Defined: DefinedCards$ names the cards (the Remembered set,
//     Breathstealer's Crypt); only cards still in the target's hand move.
//   - Mode$ LookYouChoose / YouChoose / RevealTgtChoose: the same asking
//     shape as RevealYouChoose — a CHOSER (the caster for Look/You; the
//     first player target for RevealTgtChoose) names the cards out of the
//     discarder's hand, a per-target cursor (Ctx.DiscardTarget) attaches
//     each answer to the target that gave it, and every later target poses
//     its own ask.
//
// DiscardValid$ is a Forge filter spec ("Card.nonLand", "Card.NamedCard"),
// evaluated with MatchesSpecFrom (the same resolver effDig uses for
// ChangeValid$). Its default is "Card". The chooser/target split is what keeps
// Thoughtseize from letting the opponent pick their own discard, and what
// keeps a Mind Rot target's own choice from being made by the caster.
// discardRiders carries the two Discard riders Forge applies per discarded
// card (DiscardEffect -> Player.discard): RememberDiscarded$ records the card
// in the resolution's Remembered set -- the ctx-level set a chained
// SubAbility reads for "the cards discarded this way" -- AND event-backed on

// effDig implements Forge's Dig: look at the top DigNum cards of Defined$'s
// library, move up to ChangeNum of the ones matching ChangeValid$ (default
// "Card") to DestinationZone$ (default "Hand"), and put everything else on
// the BOTTOM of the library in an order the player picks (the default Forge
// leaves unwritten; measured at the current pin, 518 of the corpus's 737 Dig
// lines carry no DestinationZone2$ and no SkipReorder$ and take this
// default). The remainder's second destination DOES exist in the corpus as
// "DestinationZone2$" (with "LibraryPosition2$" placing it in a library) --
// an earlier note here wrongly claimed the parameter does not exist; it is
// read below. The primary LibraryPosition$ is applied after the primary
// pile settles, including across an ordered-bottom remainder ask.
//
// A real card can also write "ChangeNum$ All" (e.g. Goblin Guide's own Dig)
// to mean every matching card within the DigNum look, with no cap short of
// that. changeNum's own upper bound is already the size of the dug slice, so
// defaulting it to digNum and only overriding that default for a literal or
// SVar ChangeNum$ handles "All" for free: it is simply the case where
// nothing narrows the cap below the number of cards looked at.
//
// The look-and-take ask (dig1): where the top DigNum window holds STRICTLY
// more ChangeValid$-eligible cards than ChangeNum, the pick is a real
// decision and effDig poses it -- the same strict-supersets rule effDiscard's
// TgtChoose arm already uses, so a decision nobody could answer differently
// is never emitted. ChangeNum$ 0 (the corpus's three reveal-machinery digs:
// birthing_ritual, sanity_grinding, stomping_slabs) takes nothing, so the
// ask gate also requires changeNum > 0 -- otherwise a zero cap with any
// eligible card would pose a Min==Max==0 KChoose whose only legal answer is
// the empty one, a decision nobody could answer differently by definition.
// ChangeNum$ Any is the third cap: Forge's any-number take (Jace, the Mind
// Sculptor's "You may put that card on the bottom", Through the Forest
// Gate's "put any number of land cards"), so it caps at the window and
// lowers the ask's Min to 0 whenever an eligible card exists -- a real
// choice, unlike what an earlier note here claimed take-all (measured: the
// unresolvable-value Num read degraded Any to 0 and those digs took
// NOTHING). The look is recorded first as a Secret Note carrying the
// window's ids (only the library's owner may know what sat on top; the same
// channel effRearrangeTopOfLibrary uses, with the ids added so the owner's
// client can render what was seen -- view/redact.go rule (1) passes a Secret
// event's payload to its own Player and strips it from everyone else). The
// decision is a KChoose over the ELIGIBLE cards only, in library order: an
// ineligible card must not be pickable, so it is not offered (the window
// itself is on the look Note; the prompt names the card text). Min honours
// Optional$ -- 0 when the take is optional, ChangeNum when it is not -- and
// Max is ChangeNum. The answer re-enters through ResumeKind "dig" with
// Ctx.Dig/DigDone and the asking target's index set (rules/resolution.go),
// scoped to this primitive like every other Ctx answer field.
//
// A host that cannot answer (the fuzz/no-engine stand-in, R-9) and the
// no-choice path (eligible <= ChangeNum) keep the take deterministic: the
// first ChangeNum eligible cards in zone order move, and the remainder takes
// its second destination -- by default the bottom, ordered (asked; offered
// order without a host). A resumed multi-target Dig applies
// the answer only to the target that asked, skips earlier targets that already
// completed before suspension, and preserves that same deterministic behaviour
// for every later target; chained per-library asks remain separate work. The
// no-choice path asks NO take decision, but it is not event-free when the
// remainder moves: a default-remainder Dig still moves its untaken cards to
// the bottom (asking for that order when two or more remain), so only a game
// that never reaches a Dig whose remainder moves replays byte-identically to
// the pre-dig1 engine.
//
// The variant params (task inbox-paramcensus-dig-variants), each read
// below:
//
//   - Reveal$ True reveals the dug window to the whole table BEFORE any
//     take -- a non-Secret Note carrying the window's ids, the same shape
//     effReveal's public arm emits (Ad Nauseam "Reveal the top card", Chaos
//     Warp, Goblin Guide, Matter Reshaper). It replaces the ask path's
//     private look when a real choice follows the reveal.
//   - NoReveal$ True suppresses that window reveal. A guard, not a
//     behaviour change: the corpus's 84 NoReveal lines carry no Reveal$, and
//     the dig's moves were already Secret before this task (Impulse).
//   - ForceRevealToController$ True reveals each MOVED card publicly before
//     its Secret move -- Ancient Stirrings' "you may reveal a colorless card
//     from among them and put it into your hand" (the window itself stays
//     private). Suppressed when the window was already revealed.
//   - Tapped$ True taps a card the primary move sends to the battlefield,
//     the same MoveZone-then-Tap pair effChangeZone's Tapped$ movers emit
//     (Through the Forest Gate: "put any number of land cards ... onto the
//     battlefield tapped").
//   - DestinationZone2$ (with LibraryPosition2$) is the remainder's second
//     destination: every window card the primary move did not take goes
//     there (Chaos Warp and Goblin Guide's unmatched card back to the
//     library, Matter Reshaper's unmatched card to the hand). OMITTED -- the
//     corpus's default -- it is the library bottom (Ancient Stirrings' own
//     Oracle: "put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order").
//   - LibraryPosition2$ places a library DestinationZone2$: "0" = top,
//     which leaves the cards exactly where they are, so the placement
//     emits nothing; "-1" = bottom, the ordered-bottom KArrange ask (or,
//     for a one-card remainder, the deterministic move -- one card has
//     exactly one possible order); anything else is named in a loud Note
//     and the card stays (the corpus carries only "0" and "-1").
//   - SkipReorder$ True suppresses both the bottom default and a
//     DestinationZone2$ remainder placement: the untaken cards never move,
//     so they stay on top in their existing relative order (the corpus
//     never pairs the two; Through the Forest Gate carries it without one).
//   - WithMayLook$ True (Ixhel, Scion of Atraxa; Gonti; Thief of Sanity;
//     Scarlet Witch) grants the exiling effect's controller -- never the
//     exiled card's owner -- a lasting look at the face of every card the
//     Dig exiles face down. It is applied by the shared applyFaceDownMarker
//     (effects/zone.go) on the primary move's MoveZone, so the Dig calls the
//     one read every other face-down mover uses: the looker rides the
//     "exiled_with_face_down_maylook" marker's Amount and the projection
//     (view/cardViews) admits exactly that player. Absent the param the
//     marker is unchanged, so every non-maylook Dig emits byte-identically.
//
// Still unread here: RestRandomOrder$ (the bottom pile returns in the
// answered/offered order, never shuffled) and the exotic DestinationZone2
// values (PlanarDeck). The primary optional election, primary
// LibraryPosition$, Choser$ and DigNum$ X are handled by this walk.

// bottom via Move's zone append, "0"/absent = the stay-in-place default so
// no event). The cards AFTER the found card stay in the library untouched —
// the scan stops at the amount-th match, unlike Dig's fixed window.
//
// OptionalFoundMove$ True (4 corpus lines — Songbirds' Blessing) makes the
// found move a real yes/no ask to the library's owner (the attach_optional
// KChoose shape): "yes" moves to FoundDestination$, "no" — the decline —
// to OptionalNoDestination$ when the SA carries one, else the found card
// JOINS the revealed pile (the corpus oracles all say "then put all cards
// revealed this way that weren't put onto the battlefield on the bottom":
// Genesis Storm, Hei Bai, Aurora Awakener). A no-host (AskNoHost) declines
// deterministically (R-9); botpolicy's clamp fallback answers option 0 =
// "yes". RevealRandomOrder$ True (54 corpus lines) shuffles the pile's
// RETURN order to the bottom of the library through the engine's seeded
// generator (h.Rand), so it replays exactly; the public reveal Note and the
// Remembered capture stay in scan order because reveal order is a reveal-time
// fact. A stay-in-place placement (RevealedLibraryPosition$ "0"/absent, e.g.
// Indomitable Creativity) cannot express a random order at all, so it keeps
// the existing order behind one loud Note.
//
// Riders implemented: RememberFound$ / RememberRevealed$ (the ctx-level
// Remembered discipline digRemember uses), Tapped$ (the MoveZone-then-Tap
// pair effDig's battlefield take emits) and GainControl$ (the found
// permanent enters under the resolving controller via the ordinary
// ControlChange event). A found card with an AURA face put onto the
// battlefield gets the CR 303.4f non-cast-entry attach, degraded to the
// deterministic stand-in: the first permanent in the controller's
// battlefield zone order that satisfies the Enchant keyword's own spec. If
// more than one permanent qualifies, the controller chooses the bearer; a
// sole candidate is taken without an answer. With NO eligible bearer the Aura
// stays in the library (CR 303.4f's remain-in-current-zone) rather than
// entering unattached and dying to the CR 704.5m SBA. Riders withheld with
// one loud Note per parameter and the core move still running: a non-literal
// Amount$ token is resolved as an SVar name through the count evaluator
// (literals 1..5 ARE honoured as "keep revealing until N matches", literal 0
// means the scan reveals nothing); Shuffle$ True shuffles the dug library
// after the moves (ShuffleCondition$ NoneFound restricts it to a scan that
// found nothing); NoMoveFound$ True leaves the found card in the library;
// FoundLibraryPosition$ places a library-destination found card at the bottom
// ("-1") or leaves it on top ("0"/absent, no event); ImprintFound$ /
// ImprintRevealed$ record the found / all-revealed cards on the source's
// imprint association (the Seek "seek-found" list); NoneFoundDestination$ /
// NoneFoundLibraryPosition$ give the nothing-found branch its own
// destination. What remains withheld: Amount$ whose SVar is absent or
// unresolvable (amount 1 then) and DigZone$ (every corpus value is
// PlanarDeck, and this build has no planar tier). RevealRandomOrder$ True is
