// TestReconfigureFaceDownKeepsCreature keeps the filter grammar and the
// layer walk on ONE answer for a face-down attached reconfigure card (the
// r2 review MINOR, same attach-time-internal-inconsistency class as the
// disclosed attachableTo divergence). rules/layers.go's
// reconfigureTypeSwitch guards its CR 702.150c strip with
// `o.FaceDown && o.Zone == state.ZBattlefield`: a face-down battlefield
// permanent keeps its CR 708.5 set, because its printed face -- and with it
// the Reconfigure keyword the switch keys on -- does not exist while face
// down. effects/filter.go's hasType (the every-filter-read path: target
// offer, Count$Valid, cost candidates, statics' Affected$) carried the same
// strip WITHOUT the guard, so a face-down attached reconfigure card read
// non-Creature to the filter grammar while the layer walk still said
// Creature. The guard is now shared; both reads agree that the face-down
// battlefield card (whose printed face is Razorfield Ripper's own creature
// face) stays a creature, and the face-up attached form stays non-Creature.
//
// Reachability: not through the printed-ability path (abilities are hidden
// face down) -- an external Choices$-pool attach onto a manifested
// reconfigure card is the shape this leaf protects, so the next sibling
// that attaches an arbitrary object cannot reintroduce the split.
