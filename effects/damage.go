// doing nothing, and TestDealDamageDefaultsMissingNumDmgToZero already locks
// in the zero default.

// battlefield (destroyed or sacrificed in response, say) is not a legal
// recipient any more -- the effect does nothing to it rather than marking
// damage on a card sitting in a graveyard. See the Task 18 report for how

// deals damage" primitive (Wave of Reckoning's "Each creature deals damage
// to itself equal to its power", the fight family's two-sided shapes, the
// Sarkhan the Masterless attack trigger).
//
// The grammar below is measured over the corpus's 29 EachDamage carriers:
//
// Damagers (exactly one of):
//   - ToEachOther$ <ref>: the named set is BOTH damagers and recipients --
//     each member deals to every OTHER member (Grim Contest, The Great
//     Aerie).
//   - DefinedDamagers$ <spec>: one Defined resolver spec (ParentTarget,
//     Targeted, Targeted.YouCtrl, Remembered, or the "Valid <filter>"
//     battlefield sweep).
//   - ValidCards$ <spec>: the DamageAll battlefield sweep, seat order then
//     zone order.
//
// An unresolvable or empty damager set is a fail-closed no-op -- the
// standing filter convention (an unknown predicate matches nobody), never
// a guess at the resolving source.
//
// Recipients, in precedence order:
//   - EachToItself$ True: each damager damages itself (Wave of Reckoning,
//     Solar Blaze, The Akroan War's tapped sweep).
//   - ToEachOther$: the OTHER members of the damager set.
//   - Defined$ <spec>: the ordinary Defined resolver (Self, ParentTarget,
//     Opponent, Remembered, TriggeredAttackerLKICopy, ...).
//   - the SA's own ValidTgts$ targets: the mid-resolution target ask's
//     answer (effects.Resolve's generic pre-ask, the Kamahl's Will /
//     coordinated_clobbering family).
//
// Amount: NumDmg$ is PER DAMAGER -- Count$CardPower/CardToughness evaluate
// bound to each damager (a per-damager Ctx whose Source is the damager,
// keeping the resolution's own SVar table so Nissa's Judgment's NumDmg$ X
// still finds the spell face's SVar), which is what makes EachDamage
// different from DamageAll, whose NumDmg resolves once against the
// resolution's source. Default 1 (DamageAll's default; every corpus line
// carries NumDmg$ so the default is defensive only); negatives clamp to 0
// like both siblings.
//
// Every hit is its own damage source: one rider per damager, built through
// the same newDamageRider the siblings use (so a DamageSource$ override, if
// one ever appears on a corpus line, resolves through its existing spec
// arm), and SetDamageSource published around each damager's pass -- the
// lifelink rider, the deathtouch mark, protection and the DamageDone
// triggers all read the DAMAGER, and the pg2 referent machinery binds it.
// The whole pass is one simultaneous damage batch (CR: the creatures deal
// their damage at the same time even though the log serializes the hits),
// so DamageDealtOnce/DamageDoneOnce latch per pass and LifeLostAll-style
// triggers observe the group once.
