// effMyriad implements CR 702.109's Myriad: when a creature with Myriad
// attacks, for each opponent OTHER than the defending player, the controller
// creates a token that is a copy of the attacking creature, tapped and
// attacking that opponent. The trigger (cards/keywords.go) fires on the
// source's own DeclareAttackers event, so the combat is already in progress.
// For EACH eligible opponent, CR 702.109 says the controller MAY create a
// copy. The choices are posed one at a time and resume with a deterministic
// candidate cursor: an answer creates (or declines) precisely that opponent's
// token before asking the next one. This avoids turning several independent
// may choices into a mandatory all-or-none operation.
//
// events.MyriadCleanup exiles these marked tokens as end combat ends. The
// copy is the source's current card/face, preserving its printed
// characteristics for the token's battlefield lifetime.
