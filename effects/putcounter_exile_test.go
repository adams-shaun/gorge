// zone, not just the battlefield -- a suspended card's time counters sit on
// its exiled card (CR 702.62a), and The Tenth Doctor's recalled permanent
// takes them in exile. effPutCounter's ordinary target loop carried a
// battlefield-only precondition that silently dropped the whole instruction
// for a non-battlefield recipient (ETB$ True was the sole tolerated
// exception); these pins resolve the REAL effPutCounter through Resolve with
// an inline SA whose Defined$ referent is a remembered object in exile, and
// assert both the zone precondition and the counter delta.
