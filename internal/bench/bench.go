// Package bench is the policy-agnostic, head-to-head game matrix shared by
// cmd/botbench and cmd/policytune. It owns the three pieces both callers
// need and neither should re-implement:
//
//   - the engine drive loop (PlayGame), including the two watchdogs and the
//     livelock recovery, with an optional per-decision observer so a caller
//     that wants statistics or a trace can hook it without a second copy of
//     the loop;
//   - the deterministic seed/seat/classification helpers (PlaysSeat,
//     GameSeedPair, PolsFor, Classify, FirstTurnSeat) that make a run a pure
//     function of (base seed, pairs, games) and nothing else;
//   - the pair-matrix scheduler (RunPairs), which plays every pair with its
//     own workers and folds the slots in ascending game order, so the tally
//     and the first error are identical regardless of how many workers ran.
//
// The caller supplies two SIDE seat constructors per pair (side A and side
// B); the scheduler decides which side sits in which seat each game
// (PlaysSeat), builds that game's two seats, and hands them to the caller's
// per-game player. Two different constructors therefore reach the two seats
// even when both sides are the same named policy -- the property policytune
// relies on to put w+ on one side and w- on the other.
//
// Nothing here reads a wall clock, ranges over a map whose order can reach
// its output, or uses the global math/rand; a caller's logs and reports stay
// byte-deterministic across runs.
