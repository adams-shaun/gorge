// recordExtraLandExclusion teaches the NEGATIVE observation a declined land

// observed opponent made no hand-to-battlefield move at all. The public state
// up to that frame is identical in every world that gets this far (the prefix
// matched), so the land drop the replay took was open to the observed seat
// too -- and the replay policy never passes main-phase priority while a
// play_land option is offered (botpolicy decide: chooseTap, then chooseLand,
// both before any pass). Every world that holds a spare copy of that land at
// this frame is therefore rejected with probability one, and removing those
// worlds from the proposal leaves the accepted-world distribution exactly
// what it was: the importance weight of each surviving world is computed
// under the constrained plan, the same way a cast exclusion's is.
//
// "Spare" is what Cap expresses: the copies the shuffle's deadlines already
// place in hand (observed plays of the same land) stay allowed. A Cap that
// counts a play observed AFTER this frame only loosens the constraint, which
// costs acceptance, never correctness.
//
// It fails closed -- counted, never taught -- when the inference is not
// airtight: the frozen phase, a frame where the observed seat DID move a card
// from hand to the battlefield (a different-land competition depends on
// chooseLand's hand-dependent ranking, not on a fixed preference), a replay
// move that was not a land play, the actor's own seat, and any shuffle of
