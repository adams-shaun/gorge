// Feed is one search actor's observation stream: the searchprobe.Collector
// and searchprobe.History the sampler needs, maintained by whoever drives the
// engine across that actor's whole game.
//
// It exists because Choose needs a History and a seat cannot build one
// (see this package's doc): searchprobe.Collector.Capture takes a
// *rules.Engine and the raw event burst since the previous capture, and must
// run at EVERY decision of EVERY player, while a seat is invoked only at its
// own. So the driver owns one Feed per search seat, calls Observe at every
// decision of every player, and the seat reads the accumulated History back
// through HistoryRef at its own decisions. cmd/searchteacher's game loop and
// internal/bench.PlayGame (the seat-driving bench) both go through this one
// type, so the two capture paths cannot drift -- and because the extraction
// is behaviour-identical to the loop the teacher always ran, the label corpus
// the generator emits is byte-for-byte what it emitted before the Feed
// existed (pinned by the reference label hash the task keeps).
//
// A Feed is single-goroutine: one game's driver, one seat. Nothing here
// mutates engine state -- Capture is a read-only projection -- so observing
// a game never moves an event, a chain head or a replay.

	// never observes again (the teacher's loop set observing=false and played
