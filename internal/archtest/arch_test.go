//
// cmd/testtime is exempt because it is a build-time developer tool, not part
// of the engine or the server: it stamps each TEST_HISTORY.md row with the
// UTC time the measurement was taken. Nothing it produces reaches a game, an
// event, a view or a replay, so D16's determinism argument does not apply.
// cmd/botbench is exempt for the same class of reason: its grind mode reads
// the wall clock only to bound its own run window (deadline) and report per-
// deck elapsed time — how long the BENCH chose to run, not anything a game,
// event, view or replay depends on. cmd/ledger is exempt likewise: it stamps
// the ledger document's Generated: field for the dashboard, a docs tool
// output, never engine state.
// cmd/searchprobe is another diagnostic tool: it measures corpus load, total
// elapsed time and per-root sampling/search cost. It injects a clock into the
// experimental harness only for returned metrics; fixed work counts, explicit
// seeds and ordinary engine execution govern every proposal and action.
// cmd/searchteacher (the 2026-09-19 search-teacher spike) is exempt on the
// same terms: it reads the clock only to report per-decision sampling and
// search milliseconds; no proposal, rollout, label or game reads it.

// target's chain is named `resume`, so `e.resume.outer = ...` is caught, but
// an alias that hides the field — `rp := e.resume; rp.outer = ...` — leaves
// no `.resume` name in the LHS and defeats it. Measured alias-free at this

// `rp` snapshots in `handleModes` (rules/resolution.go:133) and
// `releasePendingDecisionOfDepartedPlayer` (rules/sba.go:661), and neither is
// ever assigned through (each holds the pointer only until `e.resume = nil`
// and then passes it to `resumeResolution`, which writes `e.resume.outer`
// directly rather than through the alias). The rule is therefore a syntactic
