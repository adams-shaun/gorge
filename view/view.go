// RoundOf is the EXACT round-trip count, folded over the ordered event

// and the event log -- it reads g.Players (the seat count) and the
// events.PlayerLost / events.TurnChange stream, writes nothing, and cannot
// change a chain head -- so it is identical across a live game and a
// log-only reconstruction of the same game (replay reproduces the same
// events, and this fold is deterministic on them).
//
// The rule, stated precisely: the fold is ANCHORED ON THE GAME'S STARTING
// PLAYER -- the seat the first TurnChange hands the turn to (the CR 103.1
// toss winner, resolved over the survivors). Turn order is the cyclic order
// that begins at that anchor, not at seat 0 (before the toss it was seat 0,
// which is why the old rule read "lowest-index survivor" -- a board clock
// fed a game whose toss started seat 1 ran one round ahead all game, ~half
// of 2-seat and ~3/4 of 4-seat games). A round boundary is a TurnChange
// that hands the turn to the first still-living seat IN THAT CYCLIC ORDER --
// i.e. play has returned to the seat that opened the current pass. Round 1
// is the initial pass, so the very first TurnChange never counts as a
// boundary (the fold reads it as the anchor and skips the increment); each
// later return to the then-first survivor opens a new round. The fold
// tracks the alive set itself by folding PlayerLost events, so it knows the
// first survivor at every moment rather than only at the end -- the thing a
// snapshot cannot recover.
//
// The edge cases fall out of the one rule. First round before any turn: no
// TurnChange has been seen, so RoundOf is 1 and the anchor is unset; the
// first TurnChange establishes the anchor and never increments. A seat
// eliminated MID-ROUND (not the anchor): the first survivor is unchanged,
// so the survivors after the death simply get a shorter cycle and no
// boundary fires until play genuinely returns to that (unchanged) first
// survivor. A seat eliminated who WAS the anchor (the starting player): the
// anchor moves to the next living seat in turn order from the starter, and
// the next turn to reach that new anchor -- which the old anchor's death
// immediately makes imminent -- opens a new round. This is the case that
// breaks a naive "the active index fell" wrap rule: when the anchor dies
// during its own turn, the turn passes to the next seat (an index RISE when
// the starter was seat 0), yet play has returned to the first still-living
// seat in the anchor's order, so it IS a round boundary. The count is
// monotonic non-decreasing: it only ever increments, never repeats a value
// for a later state and never jumps backwards.
//
// Extra turns (a card granting a seat two turns inside one round-trip) are
// out of scope for this build: beginTurn is reached only from genesis and
// from rules/turn.go's NextAlive advance, and the effects registry
// registers no AddTurn primitive, so the engine never produces a same-seat
// repeat turn for the fold to misread; if AddTurn ever lands, this fold
// must be revisited.

// complete pass of every surviving seat, round 2 the second, and the round
// length (AliveCount) shrinks as seats are eliminated.
//
// This is the SNAPSHOT-ONLY APPROXIMATION, kept as the fallback for a
// consumer that has only a state.Game (the cmd/* tools and this package's
// own tests are the ones that genuinely lack the log). It is exact only when
// the game's starting player is seat 0 (a snapshot cannot recover the CR
// 103.1 toss winner the round anchor needs) and before the first
// elimination; after either, it runs AHEAD of the true round-trip count --
// the exact one is view.RoundOf, folded over the ordered event stream,
// which is what host uses to build the board clock and what the AGENTS.md
// row names as the honest fix. Do not route a log-bearing caller
// through this function; it is here so a snapshot-only caller still gets a
// never-wrong-direction round rather than a panic, and because the log is
// genuinely unavailable in that shape.
//
// This is a projection of View's existing state and nothing else: it reads
// g.Turn and each seat's Lost flag, writes no event, and cannot change a
// chain head. It is computed from the single snapshot because neither view
// nor the client keeps a per-turn history; the consequence is that it
// cannot reconstruct WHEN a seat died, only the current alive set. Two
// truths follow and are worth writing down. First, before the first
// elimination it is exactly the round-trip count. Second, after an
// elimination it stays monotonic -- 1+(Turn-1)/AliveCount only ever grows
// as Turn grows and only grows faster when AliveCount shrinks -- so it
// never repeats a value for a later game state and never jumps backwards,
// which is the failure the board's clock must not exhibit; it may run ahead
// of the literal "when play returned to the round's anchored seat" count,
// because that count needs the death times (and the starting player) this
// snapshot does not carry.
//
// Extra turns (a card granting a seat two turns inside one round-trip) are
// taken care of by the engine's shape, not by this function: beginTurn is
// reached only from genesis and from rules/turn.go's NextAlive advance, and
// the effects registry registers no AddTurn primitive, so this build never
// produces a same-seat repeat turn for the projection to account for.
