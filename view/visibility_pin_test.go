package view

// Task c7: pin what each visibility reveals. All the invariants below are
// individually verified live against a running server (the brief), but almost
// none of them were pinned by a test -- the single pre-existing zone test
// projected for viewer 0 and then inspected player 0's OWN zones, so it would
// still pass if an opponent's graveyard were redacted to empty. This file is
// the missing pin.
//
// The board is built so that EVERY player has a non-empty hand, graveyard,
// exile and library with DIFFERENT counts per player (per zone), so no
// assertion below can pass on a coincidental zero or on two seats sharing a
// value. The four tests are deliberately named per visibility so a mutation
// can be shown against the exact test it breaks.
//
// What is being pinned:
//   - A player's hand is private. Other seats and public spectators see its
//     count (HandSize) and never the cards (drawn from the V1 production
//     incident where a snapshot endpoint returned a god view mid-game).
//   - Graveyard and exile are fully public: every seat and every public
//     spectator sees every card in every player's graveyard and exile.
//   - Library is never listed, in ANY mode -- the omniscient spectator
//     included (spec D12: library order spoils draws). Only LibrarySize.
//   - Omniscient additionally reveals every hand and every mana pool.

// visibilityBoard builds a 4-seat game where every player has a non-empty,
// per-player-distinct count of cards in every zone that this rule set talks
// about. Counts per zone per seat:
//
//	zone       seat0 seat1 seat2 seat3
//	library       6     5     7     4
//	hand          3     2     4     1
//	graveyard     2     4     1     3
//	exile         1     3     2     4
//
// No two seats share a hand/graveyard/exile/library count within a zone, so a
// redaction that swaps "just the count" for "the count of someone who happens
// to have the same number of cards" cannot silently pass. Each player also
// gets a mana pool whose green symbol count equals 1+seat, again distinct, so
// the pool-reveal assertions cannot pass on a shared or zero value either.
