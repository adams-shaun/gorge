// RedactEvents strips what a viewer must not see out of a batch of events,
// building a copy of each -- the log is shared across every seat's
// projection, and a live rules.Engine's own log must never be touched by a
// read path.
//
// Call with the game state as of the LAST event in evs: rules (2) and (3)
// below ask "is this object CURRENTLY sitting in a hidden zone", and
// "currently" means at that point in the log, not at the moment the event
// was originally emitted. A live stream redacts each newly-appended batch
// against the game that batch just produced; a playback viewer (Task 24)
// passes the state reconstructed as of that point in the log, not the
// game's eventual final state.
//
// Three rules, applied to a COPY of each event -- the input slice, and
// every event in it, is never mutated:
//
//  1. Secret: rules (2)/(3) below never apply to a Secret event, for
//     EITHER branch of this rule -- a Secret event is wholly its emitter's
//     to redact-or-not, not something additionally filtered id-by-id.
//     - Player != viewer: keep ONLY the event's shape (Seq, Kind,
//     Player, From, To, Step, Secret) and zero every payload field
//     (Obj, Amount, Counter, Text, IDs, Pairs). This is an allowlist
//     of what SURVIVES redaction, not an enumerated list of what to
//     strip from it (Ruling T23-s, closing review finding I-2): a
//     future Secret emitter that starts carrying Pairs or Amount is
//     covered automatically, which an enumerated strip list is not.
//     - Player == viewer: pass through untouched -- it is their own
//     secret.
//  2. Not Secret, a zone-move kind (MoveZone, Draw, PutOnStack): its Obj is
//     stripped when the move is entirely between hidden zones
//     (From.Hidden() && To.Hidden()) and the moved object is not visible
//     to viewer (visibleTo, below). A move FROM a public zone stays public
//     -- everyone already saw the permanent bounce to hand.
//  3. Not Secret, every other kind EXCEPT Note: any id referenced by Obj,
//     IDs or Pairs is stripped when it is not visible to viewer. Note is
//     exempt (Ruling T23-w): a Note is the engine's explicit "tell
//     everyone" channel -- effReveal/effRevealHand/effPeekAndReveal
//     (effects/cardflow.go) exist specifically to show hidden cards to
//     EVERY seat via a public Note, so a Note is public unless its own
//     emitter says otherwise by setting Secret, which rule (1) above
//     already handles in full. effRearrangeTopOfLibrary's Note (the one
//     Note that must NOT be public -- a private look at the library) is
//     therefore Secret itself, not filtered by this rule.
//
// Rule (3) is what closes review finding C-1's TriggerPush half:
// rules/trigger.go's TriggerPush.IDs (Ctx.Remembered; for a "whenever you
// draw a card" trigger, the ChangesZone-mode T: line this engine uses to
// express that, this is the card now sitting in its owner's hand) names a
// hidden-zone object without ever setting Secret, and cannot be fixed by
// widening the Secret+Player contract at the emitter: TriggerPush's Player
// is the trigger's CONTROLLER (Apply needs it to mint the ability object),
// which is not the same seat as the remembered card's OWNER, so
// Secret+Player cannot express "this payload belongs to someone other than
// the event's own Player" for that case at all. Redaction has to be
// state-aware instead, checking each referenced id's actual owner against
// the game rather than trusting the event's own Player field to name it.
// C-1's other half, effRearrangeTopOfLibrary's Note, is closed by making it
// Secret (see effects/cardflow.go) rather than by rule (3), per Ruling
// T23-w above.
//
// visibleTo's "an unresolvable id is not visible" is the safe default for
// both rule (2) and rule (3): an id nothing can currently resolve (stale
// data, a tampered log) cannot be proven safe to show, so it is treated the
// same as one this function CAN prove is hidden from viewer.
//
// A stripped id inside IDs leaves a SHORTER slice, not a zero hole in
// place; a Pair with either side stripped is dropped as a whole pair.
//
// g == nil applies rule (1) only -- there is no game state to check rules
// (2)/(3) against -- and never panics.
